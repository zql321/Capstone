[Hiring] Need graphic designer for logo/branding/website for small country winery,"I'm planning to open a small winery in the next few months in north Alabama. Right now, I'm mostly looking for a logo (a couple variations) for business cards and social media type uses just to get started. In a couple months I'll probably move forward on a website (will need small e-commerce section for ordering bottles for shipping, delivery, or pickup, a way to take reservation requests, possibly have a ""wine club"" type membership subscription). I'll eventually do some merchandise too. And I'll need various wine labels throughout the process as well (good design for each batch and meets TTB label requirements for approval).    
I'd like one to stick with one designer throughout the process who's willing to work kind of sporadically as things come up, but without any strict deadlines for the most part as I slowly build my business. 

My budget for right now is about $300 for a couple logos, with the full name Sweet Home Country Wine(ry) and maybe one with the initials SHCW. My first focus is business cards and a Facebook page, maybe fliers to pass out with some and stuff like that. Just something nice to start getting the name out there soon.     
My overall budget will be around $1500-2000 probably over the next 6-8 months for everything else mentioned above.

A little about me and my business and philosophy/mission whatever you wanna call it...    
My winery will produce pretty much exclusively country wines (wine made from basically anything besides grapes) ideally using locally grown produce as much as possible. Some are more typical like strawberry, blueberry, or peach, but part of my focus is on unique small batches of wines you've definitely never tried before and probably never even heard of. Tropical fruits, herbs, vegetables, flowers can all make interesting wines. Right now I've got a rice and raisin wine, a potatoe wine, and lemonade wine going. They're not always winners, but it's always fun to experiment and try something new, and some of them will surprise you (seriously, try a potatoe wine sometime).     
My setup should produce about 1000 cases (12k bottles) a year of 12ish different varieties. Some will be batches of just 5 gallons (about 25 bottles) not for retail, just to try on the premises for tours and stuff. The largest batches are about 250 gal or 1250 bottles available for sale on site and through a CSA I'm partnered with.    
I like country wines specifically because I love wine, but don't like a lot of the culture  associated with ""traditional"" wines and the snootiness and pretension that often comes with it. I just like drinking wines that taste good and make me feel good.      
I also have a masters in biology, so while winemaking is definitely an art form with a lot done by taste or trial and error, I do have a decent lab setup and science the shit out of everything I can.

My location will (hopefully, still TBD) be in an arts and entertainment center so I also wanna match the general vibe with the community, which is very artsy and kind of flea market or street fair type of setup.

Hopefully that's enough info to give a good idea of what I want to portray and the kind of branding I need.

[For Hire] Youtube Script Writer,"Hey Everyone!

After a rather turbulent year working in the healthcare industry and seeing first-hand the carnage that covid left behind; I decided to put my passion to rest while the world was in flames. I have been doing this hobby for years now, mainly working on my own site and Channel. But in the last couple months I have been lucky enough to land a few clients seeking my services.

At this point, I am working part-time as a scriptwriter for a few youtube channels here and there, (not to mention my own) but now I am seeking to make this my full time job. Mainly because I LOVE doing this and because I don’t think I can muster enough strength to continue working in the health industry with this damned virus mucking around.

My Schedule is flexible, and I prioritize QUALITY above all else, Youtube is a platform unlike any other. It’s all about ENGAGING the audience… Believe me, some of these people have such little attention span that you would be lucky if your audience gets past the intro of the video. So if you want to succeed on Youtube, you need to be captivating, concise and charismatic. Qualities that are tough translate into paper, but you could save the hassle and hire someone ( like me :\] ) to take some of the brunt off your shoulders.

My rate is a little steep, $0.18 per word, but you need not worry if it’s out of your budget, I am a reasonable man and it’s negotiable (everything in life is negotiable). I usually get paid through paypal but we can work anything out!

Like I have said before I mainly work on Youtube, but I would be willing to write articles for your blog! You can Check out some of my own work at[ CulturalCurfew.com](https://culturalcurfew.com/).

[Hiring] Ben 10 Game Creator Remaster - Looking for help," Chances are if you were a Ben 10 fan during its original airing, that you played the Ben 10 Game Creator on the Cartoon Network website. The Ben 10 Game Creator offered a variety of different aliens, and the ability to make and play not only yours, but levels made from people all over the world. A trully unique and creative experience and Ben 10 fan would enjoy.

 With the downfall of Flash late 2020, the Game Creator, alongside many other flash games became wildly unavailable, or very hard to play. Until now. Fans are ready to continue its legacy, by remaking and IMPROVING upon the original GC, hopefully with new additions, such as new playable characters, enemies, and objects to interact with, adding upon the original formula.

 However, in order for the fans to make this project a reality, we are in need of a programmer, with decent enough skill to help our goal come into fruition and give something back to the fans. Unfortunately due to Ben 10 being an owned IP, the programmer, alongside the musicians and artists working on this project will NOT be able to be paid, and should rather be fueled to work on this from their passion as a Ben 10 fan. The game should also be available to download FOR FREE.

**About Me and My Experience**

I'd love to help you out by writing well-researched SEO pieces for whatever you may need! I'm an **experienced Content Writer, Proofreader, and Translator.** 

I used to work in the tech industry with a bachelor's in Computer Science, but have since left it and started freelance writing and ghostwriting. All of my work is backed up either by in-depth research or personal knowledge.

If you want to check out some of my work, visit [my portfolio](https://bossiwriter.journoportfolio.com/). Or hit me up for more samples!

**What I can offer you**

* **Content Writing:** If you're looking for someone to write blog posts, articles, social media content, reviews, and other similar things, I'm your guy! It's the content I have the most experience with, but not exclusively. I do research on all subjects required and optimize content for search engines(SEO) as well. Rates of 0.05$ ~ 0.15$ per word.

* **Ghostwriting:** Similar to Content Writing, but under NDA contracts or for any other reason that would discredit me from my work. Writing is no easy task, and it takes time. So having your work not be properly credited and nulled from the portfolio is a big deal. Naturally, this makes ghostwriting more expensive. Rates of 0.15$ ~ 0.30$ per word.

* **Proofreading:** If you already have something written but need someone to take a closer look at it, It'll be my pleasure to do so. Trust me, as I know how hard and time-consuming this can be. I can fix spelling and punctuation mistakes, improve the writing flow, or even make reading more appealing! It's all up to your needs. Rates of 0.04$ per word.

* **Translation &amp; Localization:** I've worked on a few projects translating and doing localization with Brazilian Portuguese and English, and I enjoy translating just as much as I like content writing. Rates of 0.10$ ~ 0.15$ per word.


**What to Expect**

Upon contact, you should first tell me what kind of work you're looking for, the subject, word estimate, and a deadline. If available, you should also provide the sources or references you want me to use for the work. With all of that, I'll give you the total cost of the job, and if you find it reasonable, we can move on to other subjects. You're getting your piece in a Google Docs URL or file, written according to your specifications and needs.

Also, please don't assume I'll take any jobs offered. I reserve the right to refuse anything I find to be unreasonable for my work schedule. However, if I am to take a request from you, I will let you know in a direct manner.

**When to Expect**

That is up to several factors. First, I'll reply as soon as I can, but timezones can affect that. Second, if you need something written as fast as possible, I'd have to check if I have other priority jobs. If I'm available, I can rush your job, but naturally, it'll cost more. Research time and sources provided are also taken into consideration when talking about the turnaround. With all that said, if you expect competent work within a reasonable timeframe, 1000 words in 24 hours is a great general rule of thumb.

**How to Contact**

Contact will be primarily through Reddit before moving on to another platform. I'll provide another platform for communication if I take your offer. **Reddit Chat is very buggy**, and often it doesn't work for me, so if at all possible, **avoid using it and send me a PM.**

**Payment**

Payment should be made through [PayPal](https://paypal.com/). If you require a big project that'll take several days of my exclusive attention, I expect a deposit upfront for a percentage of the total cost.",forhire,1.0

I've got over 5 years of experience freelancing all kinds of websites in almost every niche. I've worked for 2 years in a multi-national digital marketing agency where I worked with over 50 international brands.

I've also got a proven track record of helping brands win at Google updates most of the time. If your business has suffered drops in rankings and traffic, I might be able to help you as I work extensively who are not able to get back in the game after the hit.

I used to be a writer on Quora with over 900k in content views -  quora.com/profile/Devansh-Gupta-24 So, along with my content writing skills and deep knowledge of SEO, I'm really good with content marketing and research.

If you're already working with an agency or a freelancer, I can help you audit their work to check whether they're scamming you or not. I'm an honest and No BS kind of guy. Let's hop on a quick 30-min call for a free consultation from one of the best SEO experts in this industry because my mom says I'm the best SEO out there and I believe her.

If you cannot afford an SEO right now, I can provide an easy-to-implement actionable SEO audit for $200 from which you'll be able to make some small changes to sustain and protect yourself longer from Google Core updates till you can find a good enough SEO; maybe!

[For Hire] Virtual Assistant Available - Native English Speaker,"**Virtual Assistant Available**
		
I’m a semi-retired English speaking British national that’s looking for work as a virtual assistant for around 1-2 hours per day. I can be flexible with this and can work whole days if the work is urgent.
My work career was mostly based around IT, and I also have three years experience running a successful ecommerce business. I’ve written a variety of books for Kindle, written hundreds of articles for travel blogs, and set up and run multiple WordPress websites. I have a ton of common sense, which is sometime the most important aspect of a job.

I'm also into crypto, so could help with many aspects of that, especially if you need help getting started, setting up accounts, hard wallets, etc. No financial advice though.

**What can I do?**

* I can do basic tasks around WordPress, including adding new posts, moderating comments, installing and updating plugins, adding Google Analytics, etc.

* I can help with most Excel tasks.

* I can do most general admin tasks.

* I can work as customer support via email or live chat.

* I can give advice on your ecommerce site, blog, etc. This would be consultant type work. 

* I can do many other tasks, so just ask if it’s not listed above.

**Availability**

I would prefer to work a steady 1-2 hours a day, but chunks of work are equally acceptable. I’m generally available 7 days a week, so if you just need someone for one or two days per week, that would also be fine.

**Payment**

I currently charge the equivalent of $20 per hour for most tasks, although prices will be based on the project not the time it takes. Anything more complex or needing advanced skills would be charged at a higher rate. I’d let you know what this was in advance to make sure it’s acceptable.

I can accept payment via PayPal, crypto or bank transfer. 

**What I can’t do**

* I can’t do any task that involves phoning or videoing, as I don’t have a suitable space for that. 

* I can’t do anything that’s illegal or unethical.",forhire,1.0

Charaf was tasked with making a complex and clunky  website created by another entity, (and which did not quite perform as  expected) and managed to increase its functionality without further  financial investment. Mission accomplished and more. He took the vision  that was communicated to him and successfully executed it. I recommend   Charaf not just for his passion for the work he does, but as a   trustworthy human, who has core values that cannot be taught, and in my   opinion, this is a huge win for anyone who has him on board.""

"[FOR HIRE] Professional Editor specializing in Fantasy, Horror, and Sci-Fi.","Hey! I'm Lauren, a freelance editor offering thorough, professional, and experienced editorial services for your book, essay, blog, RPG, or anything in between. You'll find my approach to be new-author and self-publishing friendly and flexible.

[https://www.bookfoundryediting.com/](https://www.bookfoundryediting.com/)

Are you working with an RPG manual, gore, bizarro, harem fantasy, or other theme you think an editor may pass up? I have experience in fringe editing of all types and love to take on unconventional projects.

Working as your book project's team member, I can focus on macro elements like plot, characters, and POV or micro elements like spelling, grammar, and punctuation. My 14 years of editing and copywriting experience, degree and writing certificates, and a lifetime of studying writing craft all make me an ideal candidate for your book team.

I don't work in absolutes. The work of editing a book is a team collaboration between the editor and the author. If you prefer your protagonist's inner thoughts to be italicized, and if you like your writer ""voice"" better in present tense than in past, then we'll work together to keep your book the way you prefer. Polished, but still your own.

I provide a variety of services at different levels to fit your editing or budgeting needs:

Manuscript Critique

Developmental Edit

Line Editing/Copyediting

Proofreading

Pricing starts at $10 per 1,000 words ($0.01/word), or about $25/hr, depending on the editing type and project length. Contact me for short-form manuscript and RPG estimates.

Still not sure Foundry would be a good fit for your project? I offer free sample edits so you can be sure you like my editing style before you hire me.

Reach out to [ldonovan@bookfoundryediting.com](mailto:ldonovan@bookfoundryediting.com) to get started, or send me a PM for more details!

*Ajax Lygan, author of* The Aspect *and* Warhawk's Amnesty:

*When I was looking for a new editor, I had certain criteria. I wanted someone who understood my genre, someone who came with years of experience, and someone who could not just be an editor but also a partner that could push my writing to the next level. I had just gone through three different editors, some were good and others were not. I wanted someone who I could work long term with. When Lauren first reached out, I knew, even before the other candidates submitted their resumes, that she was going to be the one I was going to go with.*

*The level of professionalism paired with transparency and honesty was refreshing. I didn't feel like I was being sold something I didn't need, or that she was just looking to make a quick buck. She understood my needs perfectly and understood the tropes of my genre. She provided professional materials which explained what her services included, and when I had questions she offered to jump on a call. I know how silly this sounds but Lauren was the ONLY editor I interacted with that offered to get on a call with me to discuss working together.*

*When we started finalizing things to begin the work, the process was easy. She was clear on deadlines and we both understood each other's expectations. When I received my final manuscript with her edits, I was excited to dig in. After reviewing what she provided, I truly believe working with Lauren has helped me produce a better book.*",forhire,1.0

Does this sound like you? Do you have big dreams for a home workout plan but lose the motivation when it comes time to do it?

Send me a message describing the workout schedule you would like to have for yourself, and choose an amount of money that would keep you motivated to stick to it (minimum $15 per session). I will check in with you later in the day and if you didn’t stick to your schedule, you will have to pay me your cancel fee.

How do you get paid and how much?

Perpetual?

This means if you bring me a customer and they become a monthly client, you also will be paid monthly, even if you only referred them once! So this very well can become a passive income stream for you!

"[Hiring] (Remote within US) Venture-backed fintech hiring for multiple roles in engineering, sales, and customer success","**[Apply here!](https://angel.co/company/sunnydayfund/jobs)**

Update 8/16: We're also looking for Fall/Spring interns!!

Sunny Day Fund™ is a fintech startup that offers employer-rewarded emergency savings accounts as an HR benefit to workers. We're trying to help low- and middle-income employees build savings for the near to mid term, and we're extremely mission-driven around the idea of financial inclusion.

Check out [our website](https://www.sunnydayfund.com/) for more information about what we do, and our [careers page](https://www.sunnydayfund.com/careers) for more information about the positions on offer.

I've put compensation info and quick versions of the job descriptions below, but we'd prefer to track everything through our [AngelList](https://angel.co/company/sunnydayfund)… mods if this breaks the linking rules, please let me know and I will delete this part. I'm not an affiliate or somehow profiting off of the link; I'm the engineering team lead.

#Product &amp; Engineering

##Product Manager

$90-140k + 0.1%-0.5% equity

We're looking for someone to organize client needs into requirements as well as guide the day-to-day of our agile/scrum product team. 3+ years of product management experience (particularly within enterprise SaaS and/or fintech), 1+ years of technical experience.

##Full-Stack Engineer

$75-115k + 0.05%-0.25% equity

We're on a modern JS stack + some industry-specific back-end integrations. It's definitely a plus if you've shipped work with Strapi/Synapse/Unit/Finch or similar tools, and TypeScript/Angular on the front end. But we're more interested in how you solve problems; the right candidate can always pick up a new tool or stack.

##Senior Full-Stack Engineer, Integrations

$100-150k + 0.01-0.5% equity

Looking for someone having all of the above + deeper experience in banking and/or payroll (preferably both)

#Revenue

##Strategic Partnerships Manager

$70-105k + 0.01-0.25% equity

Track record building partnerships for mutual revenue opportunities, deep familiarity with CRMs (particularly HubSpot)

##Sales Operations Analyst

$55-65k + 0.01-0.05% equity

This is somewhat of a hybrid role that exists between day-to-day ops like managing scheduling and CRM, data entry, etc., for other sales team members, and a more traditional entry-level sales role. Salary noted above is before commission; as mentioned above I'm the eng lead so idk exact numbers on the commission structure.

#Customer Success

##Customer Success Manager

$65-95k + 0.01-0.2% equity

Requires 4+ years of experience w/ B2B enterprise SaaS companies, preferably in the HR or finance space. We're a very small company right now so you'd likely be defining a lot of our formal processes for dealing with clients.

##Customer Success Associate

$40-55k + 0.01-0.1% equity

This is more of a front line customer service type position, helping our users solve day-to-day issues. You'd mostly be using Slack, Trello, and ZenDesk. The customer base is vetted since we sell to the employer instead of the end user directly, so this isn't some call center job where you're going to get yelled at all day. All of my interactions with our users have been lovely, even when they were frustrated about something.

#Cross-Function

##Wild Card

If you're interested in our mission and business model, but your skill set doesn't quite line up perfectly with anything you see above, we still want to hear from you! There might be a role we didn't even know we needed yet. For this kind of inquiry, it's better to reach out directly to work@sunnydayfund.com.",forhire,1.0

To sum it up:

\- Manage the process of expanding to other PPC platforms &amp; helping you succeed there as well ✅

\- Optimize &amp; manage your Google Analytics &amp; Tag Manager accounts ✅

I have someone that was going to help, but looking more into it he said this on discord:

""Hey, yep! Recordings are in progress, i´m at the moment recording all the piano parts, like E-piano- classical piano and other instruments alike.
Yes, I´ve got a lot of software through Native Instruments. The problem is still with the licensing though. I talked to some proffesionals, and the problem is actually global for all software. you can use instrument software all that you want for everything, but NOT for directly transfering their raw samples to reuse. So using their samples for music is fine, but taking the sounds note for note is illegal.

""You may not sell sample(s), or give away any sample(s) for use by any other person(s).""

I have meanwhile got access to an electric piano with a lot of different piano sounds, i´m recording all of those, hopefully with a good quality 😄""


So I imagine if I wanna try and get a big selection of instruments that I might need help from however many ppl that I can find, unless you know a simple way of going about it 
Might be able to get a group going where everyone could work together or just have a overall plan together or know who's doing what

[For Hire] The Single Most Badass Executive Assistant/Project Manager/COO You Will Ever Have.,"Firstly, thanks for stopping by. [Maybe you remember this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/cns197/for_hire_the_single_most_badass_executive/) from a couple of years ago (though probably not), but I'm back!

Second, **prepare to have your friggin' mind blown.**  Uh, again. 

Since the last time I posted, my skillset has expanded massively but I'm ready for some new challenges and I'll never discover them if I don't put myself out there. So, this post will have changed quite a bit, but I'll more or less line-by-line it for you!

&gt; ~~Do you have problems with simple things like:~~

&gt; * ~~Reading/responding to emails in a timely manner?~~
* ~~Making travel arrangements?~~
* ~~Data entry?~~
* ~~Scheduling meetings?~~

Yeah, I don't really do those things anymore. I'm definitely not a typical paper pusher, and if that's what you're looking for then you should probably move along to the next post. I'm not here to schedule your meetings or make your travel arrangements, I'll get someone else for that, I'm here to make sure your business is running as smoothly as possible. 


&gt; Or maybe some more complex problems like:

&gt; * Difficulties getting your teams to coordinate
* Making sure every individual meets their deadlines
* Inefficient systems with which to handle all of your other problems

I still do all of this, except I'm even better at it now. Working at a very fast-paced startup over the last couple of years has been very eye-opening, and my skillset has expanded rapidly to accommodate the environment.

&gt; Or even some of the most complex issues a business can face, such as: 

&gt; * Finding the right staff to suit your needs
* Maintaining ethical business practices and policies
* Problem solving, or rather, problem avoidance. Identifying potential threats to your business, its growth, and its profits. 
* Risk Management. Fits in with the above segment to a degree, but there's always more to it.
* Inefficient policies and systems — they can prevent you from growth and are the absolute death of a lot of businesses. 

Maintaining ethical business practices and policies has become increasingly important to me over the past few years. I intend for every company I work with in the future to have a code of honor and ethics that is outside of the norm for most industries these days: I believe in paying people what they're worth, and I absolutely do not subscribe to the typical work &gt; family nonsense that big business tries to push. 


All of this sound good? Well, then, I have some awesome news for you. 

**Here I am.**

I worked for the same company for 15 years in varying roles, from simple data entry when it was a two person company, to office manager as we grew, to executive assistant before the company was finally sold for a hefty profit. On top of that, I have 7 years of consulting experience working with huge brands and have had amazing results. On top of the ""on top of that"" section, there's more recent results below!

~~**Alright, but there's a lot of people that want to be virtual assistants here, what separates you from them?**~~

~~I'm not a paper pusher. I can do it, but it's not what I'm good at. I'm an assistant, here to make your life easier and your business more efficient. I'm not looking to input some numbers and call it a day, I'm looking to actually help.~~

Like I said, I'm not interested in being some data entry dude. If you're still with me at this point, that's not what you're looking for anyways. But, as promised, let's change things up a bit:

**Alright, the title of the post was, admittedly, very intriguing. What makes you so special?**

Results. The last time I made this post was August 8, 2019. I was hired by August 15, 2019. The company had a revenue of $0 and no product ready. By the end of August, we had a monthly recurring revenue of roughly $7,000. By the end of October, it was over $30,000. This was due to an obviously great product, but I also did all of the advertising personally. Did I mention I'm a really great copywriter?

Realistically, though, I'm simply driven. I have the need to constantly improve and be a better version of myself and while sometimes that can be a detriment, that's mostly a me problem. It's pretty obviously a great quality in the startup world, haha. 

**Not quite enough?**

I have a bachelor's degree.

**Still not enough?**

I have a Master's degree, too. 

I've got the experience, the education, and (most importantly, in my opinion) the need to be the best at what I'm doing. I'm also **willing to travel, or even relocate** if you decide that you'd like to hire someone long term.

**Rates:**

I'm not cheap. My last job paid me 6 figures to do what I do. I'm going to put a baseline of $45/hour simply because a price is in the rules, but we will absolutely need to go over expectations and we can reevaluate from there.

This can be remote **or in person** if you're willing to add a relocation package.

**Why in the HELL aren't you working at some massive company with qualifications like yours?**

I like people, and I like the weight of my efforts and expertise to be felt. I don't want to be working in some giant corporate atmosphere where I don't really make a difference. I want to know the people I'm working with, and I would prefer to bring success to those people rather than some guy buying his fourth yacht.",forhire,1.0

[For Hire] Experienced Youtube Script Writer and Video Editor,"Hey Everyone!

After a rather turbulent year working in the healthcare industry and seeing first-hand the carnage that covid left behind; I decided to put my passion to rest while the world was in flames. I have been doing this hobby for years now, mainly working on my own site and Channel. But in the last couple months, I have been lucky enough to land a few clients seeking my services.

At this point, I am working part-time as a scriptwriter and video editor for a few youtube channels here and there, (not to mention my own) but now I am seeking to make this my full-time job. Mainly because I LOVE doing this and because I don’t think I can muster enough strength to continue working in the health industry with this damned virus mucking around.

My Schedule is flexible, and I prioritize QUALITY above all else, Youtube is a platform unlike any other. It’s all about ENGAGING the audience… Believe me, some of these people have such little attention span that you would be lucky if your audience gets past the intro of the video. So if you want to succeed on Youtube, you need to be captivating, concise, and charismatic. Qualities that are tough translate into paper, but you could save the hassle and hire someone ( like me :\] ) to take some of the brunt off your shoulders.

My rate is a little steep, $0.18 per word and $20 an hour for video editing, but you need not worry if it’s out of your budget, I am a reasonable man and it’s negotiable (everything in life is negotiable). I usually get paid through PayPal but we can work anything out!

Like I have said before I mainly work on Youtube, but I would be willing to write articles for your blog! You can Check out some of my own work at[ CulturalCurfew.com](https://culturalcurfew.com/). Or if you would like to see some work I have done with my clients, shoot me a DM or send me an email: [CulturalCurfew@gmail.com](mailto:CulturalCurfew@gmail.com)

"[For Hire] Valuable Copy &amp; Content Writing for Startups, SaaS, E-com, and Agencies","***First time clients get a 25% OFF discounted rate on our initial project.***

Greetings: Earthlings, Entrepreneurs, &amp; Innovators alike!

I'm [Roman](https://romangeathers.com/) 👋 - A value-driven content writer and conversion copywriter focused on 2 main things for your business:

1. Writing content that **establishes you as an authority in your niche - leading to more prospects.**
2. Writing copy that **turns those prospects into customers - making you money.**

# How My Background Will Help You

I've been freelance copywriting and content writing for over 4 years now...this also includes 2 years running my own full-fledged marketing agency, catering to clients across the globe.

My digital marketing experience gave me a solid understanding of buyer's cycles in various industries, as well how to properly implement on-page SEO.

I now focus fully on writing, but these experiences have been invaluable in ensuring **I know how to put you ahead of the competition** while writing everything from articles to landing pages.

If you're a Startup, SaaS company, E-commerce store, Marketing Agency, or Web Designer/Developer, I can provide services that **help your venture reach its full potential.**

# What I Can Offer

In terms of specific services, I write:

* Articles and Blogs
* Webpage Content
* About Us and Mission Statements
* Landing Page Copy
* Sales Pages
* Email Sequences
* Product Descriptions
* Advertorials
* Non-Fiction Ebooks

But more importantly, while working with me you'll receive:

* **Clear Communication Between Us** \- No more back and forth ambiguity, I'll communicate clearly and concisely with you so you're not wondering what's going on.
* **Strict Adherence to Deadlines** \- When I say I'm going to have something done by a certain time, you can be sure you'll have it.
* **Truly High Quality Work** \- I have both testimonials from clients and direct samples to show you which prove my ability to produce top content (see next section).
* **Writing that Helps You Meet Your Goals**  \- I understand you're not looking to pay a writer for sh\*ts &amp; giggles. So let's ensure the writing you receive makes an impact.

# Why You Can Trust Me

Hiring a writer you trust to put out the content of your business can be a tricky process. Look, I get that literally anyone can claim they're a great writer and promise the whole world to you. So I won't sit here and continue to do the same thing.

Instead, I'll let testimonials and my portfolio provide credibility themselves:

**Testimonials**

# What are My Rates?

Generally, my rates are priced per word for general content writing and per project for more specialized writing/copy. I never charge by the hour for any writing, as this only takes away from pure focus on your project.

**Content Writing:** Starts at *$0.15 per word* and may be higher depending on the complexity of the subject.

**Copywriting:** Priced per project depending on what's needed. You can usually expect anywhere from *a few hundred dollars for smaller projects to $1,500+ for full-blown sales pages.* These prices are justified based on the potential earnings the projects will make you.

"[For Hire] Full-stack developer that can help you reduce cloud costs, quickly create your MVP, rescue/modify a previous project. Have an idea? I can make it a reality!","Do you have an idea for a new app?

Getting killed on cloud costs?

Do you have an existing application/stack that is on the fritz? Getting too slow? Missing features you need?

Or just needs to be reworked/repacked to be more easily manageable?

I can help you with this!

When I say I am a full-stack developer, I mean it. I have 20 years of experience in product development.

I can help you develop your idea completely, including architecture design, all back-end infrastructure, and front-end components.

In general, you can choose specific languages, frameworks, and components if you have any strong preferences.

I have very strong skills in the following areas:

* Front-end development (excluding graphic design, but very comfortable with existing front-end frameworks, CSS/CSS compilers, and javascript/typescript)
* Monolithic or hybrid application development: server, desktop, and mobile (android and iOS)
* Serverless application development / Micro-services
* Seriously scalable applications / Jamstack
* API development/integration/testing
* Devops (particularly on the AWS stack)
* Database development and management
* Webserver/appserver development and management
* Machine learning / AI (recommendations, data extraction, search)
* UX (to the extent that I know from experience what will and won't work for applications to get traction)
* Google Ads/Youtube Ads (both campaigns and campaign analysis, split tests, A/B tests for sites)

In short, if your idea is possible, I can completely build it for you! If it is broken, I can help you fix it!

I am not super-cheap (however, I am cheaper than hiring a full development house and multiple contractors!), and I am super-fast! Rates are in the range of $50/hr to $75/hr depending on the type of work required. Rates can be cheaper, usually, if work is completed as a very detailed spec job, or if long-term work is available.

I have been doing this a long time and can give you firm cost quotes and very accurate time quotes on anything you might have.

I understand that working with an online and/or new developer can be risky for both parties, so I am willing to share the risk.

After acceptance of quote, and agreement on a very specific project spec., I am willing to develop the project or specified milestones, before payment, if you are an ongoing business concern.

If not, well, let's talk! I am sure we can figure out something that we are both comfortable with.

Get the capabilities of a full development house for the price of a single developer!

pm me or post right here, if you are interested. We can talk at no cost to see if I am a good fit.

Here is some basic info and FAQ (for the USA Market)  
You can Start a Wholesale with Less than 500$, EIN (TAX ID) and Resale Tax Are important.  
Having a Website, Business Email and Logo is a Big Plus!  
To find good suppliers, Products and start actually selling takes a minimum Of 3-4 Weeks but overall it's long-term work because of all the work around it, order, shipping, prepping, etc.  


Now I offer a couple of packages:  


1. 15  Manually researched Leads to potential Wholesale brands that you can contact right away. 50$  
2. Leads + contacting those Brands (depends)  
3. All above + getting and scanning the price list. (depends)  
4. All above + Account management, 1500$/month but it's up to negotiation

What you’ll get from my services: I can ensure excellent customer service and quick, thorough communication while we work together. As stated, I’m not currently employed so I have tons of free time, which means a quicker turnaround time for media projects.

"[For hire] If you are a writer, I am the next step you are looking for. Professional translator, English to neutral Spanish (0.03 USD per word)."," Hello!

I am a pharmaceutical and editorial translator. I live in Mexico and Spanish is my native language. Talking to a writer, we arose to the issue of how complicated it is for a publisher to take the time to review the works of new authors and how it is even more unusual for them to print them. We concluded that this is motivating more and more writers to self-publish. Along these lines, it occurred to me that surely all these creators would want to expand their audience and that an effective strategy to do just that would be by translating their works into different languages.

Though, without a publisher, how do you find a professional translator with a customized approach?

Someone whom the author is free to consult or vice versa.

Well, I am that translator. 

Like I said before, I am Mexican and a professional translator. Since I like accuracy, I mainly translate from English to Spanish, as the most faithful target translation is the one you do in your native language. Sure, I can translate from Spanish to English, but why screw up perfection?

I charge 0.03 USD per word. I request a down payment. It consists of a third of the total word count in your work (source document). When the translation is completed, I request the rest of the payment. In this final payment, we calculate the cost of the new number of words, the word count usually increases by 10-15% with the translation, and subtract the down payment from that amount. For instance,

1,200 untranslated words (source) = $12 down payment

1,400 words translated (target) = $42 gross cost 

Gross cost minus down payment = $30 final payment

We would sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement and a Service Contract where we agree that the original text and translations are your proprietary information and confidential.

The Spanish that I use in life and translations is the so-called neutral Spanish —also referred to as standard, global or universal Spanish. It is the variation of Spanish most understood among Spanish speakers and, therefore, the most used in all types of content intended for this sector of the population.

Translation time depends on the amount of research the work requires (i.e., a work involving electronics, architecture, law, history, may require me to consult experts or databases). The adaptability of the work to the Spanish language also has an impact on the translation time. All works are translatable, but such translation may take longer if I have to devise a grammatically appropriate way to convey a particularly innovative style (think Dr. Seuss). 

However, I can give you a rough estimate: 20,000 words would take a range of 5-7 days to translate. 

Remember that we are talking about a professional translation. I will be careful with your work and what you want to convey in it.

All transactions are made via PayPal. There you can verify my real name, as this is my company's name. 

Incidentally, my website is under construction, but I can offer you my CV and a short translation test of around 220 words as references, plus an interview by chat or call. I want you to feel comfortable with this service because I know I'm working with your dreams.

After Mandarin and Hindi, Spanish is the fourth most widely spoken language. It comprises approximately 460 million individuals who speak Spanish natively. Wouldn't it be wonderful if they could read your book?

We'll do two sessions with 2 hours a session on Zoom with shared screens, or we can split those to make them 3 or 4 sessions if you can't focus for too long.

**Who are you?**

I'm a web designer and developer with a natural talent of teaching things.

**How easy will this be for me?**

When we're done, creating websites will be as easy for you as creating a Microsoft Word document.

**How can this not require any coding, where's the catch?**

There's absolutely no catch, it's 2021, there are ways (and often hidden from the general public) to create creative and complex websites without the need for coding

**How complex?**

I can teach you to make a website as complex as Amazon without touching code

**How many hours does that $60 cover?**

4 hours, I'm not a robot, so if we have only a few things left to clear (That will take a few more minutes) I will stay longer than that 3 hours with no extra cost.

[For Hire] Amazon Wholesale Business Expert- Done for you," 

Hi,

I'm a freelancer who helps people to get into the Amazon business.  
I specialize in Wholesale. Wholesale is one of the easiest Selling Methods you can get into and it's very easy to scale.

Now I also have 2 VA's to make the whole process faster.

I have methods to find products or brands with exact criteria such as monthly revenue, number of sales, etc. I know how to approach brands with a view to making them want to work with you and making you their reseller/distributor. I do everything from the beginning of finding products to the actual orders from the suppliers and taking care of your account.

You can make anything from 100$ as a very small investment to actual thousands of dollars.

The last client made from the first supplier 500$ in profit in the first month and we had another 3 suppliers ready

Here is some basic info and FAQ (for the USA Market)  
You can Start a Wholesale with Less than 500$, EIN (TAX ID) and Resale Tax Are important.  
Having a Website, Business Email and Logo is a Big Plus!  
To find good suppliers, Products and start actually selling takes a minimum Of 3-4 Weeks but overall it's long-term work because of all the work around it, order, shipping, prepping etc.

I charge 1500$/month but it's up to negotiation

For the references, I can share my Upwork profile with great numbers and reviews.

Specializing in Developmental Editing and Editorial Assessments, I also possess a sensitivity to language and its usage that makes me adept at Line/Copyedits in a variety of genres and styles to ensure that language is strong and meaningful for a reader. Whether you're writing a 30-page comic, a memoir, or a fantasy trilogy, let me help you make your writing—and even more importantly, your STORY—the very best it can be!

Creators who work with me frequently note my creative power and eagerness to explore even the most minute details which, when combined, produce a unique attention to detail that elevates storytelling to the next level and ensures that your message reaches your readers. With an innate sense of the nuances of linguistics and language, a lifetime of reading and a passion for storytelling as an art form makes me the type of editor who understands works far beyond their surface details: someone capable of pulling out themes and ideas within a story that even you, the story's creator, may not have been fully aware of! Working with me, you will have a mentor, teammate, and cheerleader invested in your story's success.

Interests and specialties of mine include character-driven works of literary and creative fiction, particularly in the Fantasy, Sci-Fi, Romance, and Magic genres, as well as the Young Adult (YA) and emerging New Adult (NA) genres. I am currently working on my own Fantasy series, a multi-volume illustrated series that melds the spirit of the Japanese Light Novel with western Romance and Monomythic traditions for a literary-inclined NA audience. I work frequently with stories that don't fit squarely within singular genres, and especially appreciate atypical or unique works that push me to use all of my skills.

Consultation sessions via voice chat (Discord, Streamyard, etc.) at a rate of $30/hour (minimum 1 hour).

[Hiring] Experienced Android Developer to help me fix two relatively small issues with my source code on a nearly complete app.,"I am willing to freely provide the source to anyone possibly interested in helping prior to any commitment, and the pay is completely negotiable.

I create fractal art and have recently been really into the idea of trying to make a simple APK that would install an animated wallpaper (using an MP4 video file as the source) for Android phones. With the help of some dated software called Custom Live Wallpaper Creator, I was able to freely export source code of a program built to do just that. I got pretty close, but I've hit a roadblock and could really use the help of an experienced Android developer to fix a couple of issues.

I have zero programming ability, but I was able to cheese my way pretty far ahead using the freely provided source code and Android Studio. I fixed some depreciation issues of the dated code, updated the gradle, am now targeting the latest SDK etc. The program does work, but there are two main issues I'd really like to fix.

1.) When this program was designed, 16:9 phones were pretty much the standard, and it doesn't seem to be playing well with my phone that has a 19.5:9 aspect ratio. My video/background animation is compressed on the X-axis I think in an attempt to stretch and fit the screen. Ideally the program would take this into account, and fill up the screen as much as it can while scaling the video/background appropriately, filling the parts of the screen it couldn't reach with black bars. The program I used to export the source code for the android APK has three different scaling options to choose from, I've tried tinkering with the code on all of them, but haven't had any luck. Here's a video that sort of demonstrates what I'm talking about. 
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YbUDH9e0lZAe4AAS4UOzOdc2RGGc_5Gg/view?usp=sharing

2.) I've designed the video to be a seamless looping animation. Currently though, when the video loads again, there's a slight but noticeable pause as I imagine the video is buffering once it is reloaded. I'd really like for this buffer to not be noticeable by the user. I've seen online that there maybe be some ways to get around this, like loading another instance of the same video while the first video plays, then swapping and repeat, etc. I'm not sure what the most efficient way to achieve this effect might be. Currently I have a video that repeats itself twice to kind of mitigate the rate of the buffer, but since Android APK's have a small file size limitation, and I'm technically working with HD video, it would be ideal for me to only render out what I need as it would make it possible for me to make a jump for more frames per second or a higher resolution etc.

This program uses Java I believe. It originally targeted Android API 19, so I'm sure there's some dated coding syntax or whatever ha.

I'm willing to negotiate pay and freely provide the source code for anyone to take a look at prior to making any kind of commitment. I'm really just wanting to do whatever I can to get this working, and would be really appreciative of anybody with the skill I clearly don't have to help out on this.

[Hiring] Video Editor Wanted For Motorcycle Trip Documentary,"Last month I went on a two week motorcycle trip through British Columbia, Canada. I filmed the trip using a number of GoPro cameras and I would like to hire someone to edit them into a single film.

I have about 2.5TB of footage that was filmed on a combination of GoPros, iPhone, Panasonic G85 and drone. 

One challenge is that a lot of the footage is POV from the camera mounted to my helmet. I'm not really one who enjoys vlog type videos so there's not a lot where I'm speaking to the camera. Thus, I'm not sure what type of story can be pulled from all the clips I have.

I'm thinking that we'll need some vo work and a map animation to move the story along. Check out Visual Moto Travel on Youtube for the style of video I like. I'm definitely NOT looking for any YouTube vlog style edits.

To save the editor hours and hours of watching POV motorcycle footage I can bring everything into FCP and keyword all the clips if that helps. If you also use FCP I imagine this will save you a lot of time but not sure if that will work if you use Premier.

Here's a link to a small sample of the clips I have. This gives you a rough idea of the style of the clips I have. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jti47wsqA-g

"[FOR HIRE] Music Producer | Custom Music for Artists, Content Creators, Companies, Adverts &amp; More! Starting at $15!"," 

Hello Reddit!

Are you an artist that's struggling to find and develop their own sound? Listened to thousands of beats and still can't make your choice? Here to help.

Are you a content creator and do you want your own music to avoid copyright issues? Are you a streamer and want to step up your game? Let's make an album, share it with your fans, monetize it, use it as you wish, and don't worry about getting hit with copyright strikes ever again!

Do you just want to publish some songs under your name? Let's make it happen!

After producing music for 5+ Years, and after working on 600+ Songs (Yes, you read that right) I decided to offer my music here too!  
My journey began in middle school, totally randomly, and turned into a hobby that I'm trying to turn into a full-time job.  
After working with over 200 various artists ( Unfortunately no industry placements..yet! ), after thousands of hours put into practice and after thousands of opinions I've heard It's safe to say I can provide industry-quality, enjoyable and entertaining songs for everyone.

I can produce all genres, mostly...excluding only Rock, and some of the examples are seen here:  
[EDM](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_mF3kyP_TKnDE5s5D5mL4NYOKU6QbIEw5g)  
[Lo-Fi](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_n9_oKu14kkHzQuYauH6kglwlPUlCsktx8)  
[Trap](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_l-KMepf_MoX-ang5E0QnE2jKteIIs6Xek)  
[Piano Mix (Multiple Genres Included)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_n9HKf6mv2ndW6xspwx6fKRCX9tygsXmw0)  
[8Bit](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_llwNDRCqKhPGYFXCrUvAM3NooPkellmnM)  
[Calm/Sad Mood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dV08a7JEb0w&amp;list=OLAK5uy_msO0_a0RK_ZXGlAK6tckLYg8d7Fduxz_U&amp;index=12)  
[Future House/Bass](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_nVjuug1_HVS1OZF1UDeD_2cKSRjODsbuU)  
[HipHop/Trap (With Vocals)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_nZea24FX64uyrU6nzWB0pWP79y7oJ7BZA)  
(Please keep in mind that all of the songs on the playlists are linked are already sold and owned by someone else, none of them are for sale as they're exclusive, also the links are not affiliated with me in any way, nor i make any money with them!)

Depending on the genre you're aiming for, my prices vary between $15-$30/Track.

For streamers and content creators I got album packs:

$80 - 10 songs \~ 30 minutes of playtime

$150 - 22-25 songs \~ 60-90 minutes of playtime

$200 - 35 songs \~ 100-130 Minutes of playtime

If you want to have an artist on your song that sings/raps that's $5/track additional.

Exclusive contracts are included with all the songs - which means you will own the song completely.

I can also help you publish them to all streaming platforms and show you how to monetize them!

The only thing I'll ask you for is to let me use them as my portfolio afterward, other than that you can claim them however you want!

My prices can be negotiable, feel free to let me know what you have on your mind.

Feel free to DM Me if you want to see my freelance profile with proof of 450+ orders and 270+ reviews avg 4.9/5 stars!

Feel free to ask me any questions too!

#Product &amp; Engineering

##Full-Stack Engineer

$70-150k + 0.01%-0.5% equity

We're on a modern JS stack + some industry-specific back-end integrations. It's definitely a plus if you've shipped work with Strapi/Synapse/Unit/Finch or similar tools, and TypeScript/Angular on the front end. But we're more interested in how you solve problems; the right candidate can always pick up a new tool or stack.

##Senior Full-Stack Engineer, Integrations

Looking for someone having all of the above + deeper experience in banking and/or payroll (preferably both)

##Strategic Partnerships Manager

$70-105k + 0.01-0.2% equity

Track record building partnerships for mutual revenue opportunities, deep familiarity with CRMs (particularly HubSpot)

##Sales Operations Analyst

$55-65k + 0.01-0.05% equity

This is somewhat of a hybrid role that exists between day-to-day ops like managing scheduling and CRM, data entry, etc., for other sales team members, and a more traditional entry-level sales role. Salary noted above is before commission; as mentioned above I'm the eng lead so idk exact numbers on the commission structure.

#Customer Success

##Customer Success Manager

$65-95k + 0.01-0.2% equity

Requires 4+ years of experience w/ B2B enterprise SaaS companies, preferably in the HR or finance space. We're a very small company right now so you'd likely be defining a lot of our formal processes for dealing with clients.

##Customer Success Associate

$40-55k + 0.01-0.1% equity

This is more of a front line customer service type position, helping our users solve day-to-day issues. You'd mostly be using Slack, Trello, and ZenDesk. The customer base is vetted since we sell to the employer instead of the end user directly, so this isn't some call center job where you're going to get yelled at all day. All of my interactions with our users have been lovely, even when they were frustrated about something.

[For Hire] Looking for a reader-friendly writer who doesn’t create a word soup? I’m your girl!,"Reader-friendly is search engine friendly. Gone are the days when stuffing keywords made your blog rank up in search engines. Now, it’s all about catering to your audience (and having some well-placed keywords throughout).

If you’re looking for a writer who knows her stuff and will write well-researched, engaging articles for your website, let’s talk. I’ve been writing professionally for over 6 years. I’m familiar with a variety of SEO techniques, and have helped a client climb to the first page of Google’s results within 3 months.

**WHAT I WRITE**

* Blog posts
* Articles
* Website copy
* Press releases
* Fiction (various genres and formats)
* Others on a case-by-case basis (just ask)

I also undertake editing and proofreading projects. So if you want your articles and website copy edited for errors, readability, or to add in some keywords, that’s something I can help with as well. I usually charge by the hour for all forms of editing (copy, content, proofreading), and I can copy-edit approx. 1000 words per hour.

Some things I ***don’t write*** include: anything about crypto, legal stuff, tech stuff, essays, poems, and disturbing erotica (think shock sites). Most other things are fair game.

**COMMUNICATION CHANNELS**

I can communicate through Reddit and email. I usually send files in .docx format, however, so email is preferred. I may require a phone call (via Skype, Zoom or Google Hangouts) before finalization.

**PAYMENT METHOD AND SOP**

I can accept payment through PayPal or credit cards. I accept multiple currencies, but prefer US $. Payment must be made upfront. Due to several unfortunate experiences in the past, I’ll require a contract to be signed – which will protect both you and me.

**ARTICLES WRITTEN BY ME**

Here are a couple:

[HIRING] Freelance Software Developers keen to do full-time or part-time remote gigs,"Hey! I run MomoCentral.com, we are an online freelancing platform with hand-vetted talents servicing clients with software projects of all sorts. We are looking to expand our pool of skilled software developers to fit demand.

Our talents work with our clients in a variety of arrangements, from **long term full time quasi-employment roles to quick part time gigs**. All work is **remote**, and as a platform we help take care of the admin behind the work as well as billing. We take pride in the quality of both our talents and clients and we interview every potential candidate with an eye towards keeping talent quality high and preventing lowest-bidder issues.

We accept people primarily based on our evaluation of programming/algorithmic ability, but people with experience in highly sought-after technology stacks will naturally have an easier time finding clients once in. Notable stacks we are currently short of are **fullstack Javascript (Node/React/Vue and such) as well as Ruby on Rails**.

Accepted freelancers are able to set their own rates/project prices. Most developers and designers charge a ballpark of USD 20-80/hour, depending on their location and seniority, with some very senior / specialized folks (Ex FAANG, Machine Learning / security experts etc) charging up to USD150/hour.

[Hiring] ANY Developer that Can Handle This Project - BASKETBALL GAME!,"Hello, I am Porkhopz. Sports lover, Business student. Who are you? I really want to work with a developer that cares about the project. And I believe that this is the perfect project for any developer that has the talent to handle it.  


It's called Baja Basketball. I really like how it sounds like a flower. The concept is similar to Big Win Basketball, if you don't know what this is look it up on your iPhone right now and download it. (Or just google it) Take a look at it. Of course, it will have twists and this is not going to be an app. However, you have to be capable of making this type of project or at least the basic foundation of it on a website.   


I do not mind building a framework, writing out a google document for ideas, hiring a front-end developer or back-end developer, or hiring a person for just a part of this project. Because this project is going to be special.  In fact, I already have parts of the project designed already. That you will see once we start talking.  


I wanted this post to get your attention and intrigue you because I am tired of working with people that just do not care. I want your FULL attention.   


Of course, payment depends on what specifically you are capable of doing but I am looking to complete this project on a budget of $5,000. If we have to alter it a million different ways to keep it in that budget that's fine with me. I know there is a way to get this done and I am willing to do everything I can to get it done.   


Do you have a resume? I want to see it. I want to know why I should hire you and what you offer. If you message me with the same copy and paste I do not know if I can reply to every single one of those. I want to hire the right person for this project.",forhire,1.0

[Hiring] (Online) MOBILE APP Developer - Mediapipe / Android / OpenCV /Unity /Vuforia,"Hi everyone

Looking to hire someone to help create one or two .apk files. I need to use as VIDEO INPUT SOURCE  an external usb UVC webcamera instead of the device's internal camera, then detect mouth and eyes/iris and create animation on top, or even better – don't show the video source – just animation. Basically - something similar to AR Instagram/Snapchat filters, just using an external usb camera via OTG. Budget estimate is $600 - $1200, but  it's flexible.

Apps would do the following

A)  Apk #1 - MOUTH  - capture human mouth and create an animated mouth  shown on the screen that will follow the motion of the real mouth

B) Apk #2 - EYES - capture single or both human eye/eyes and create 2 animated eyes that will follow the motion of the real eye

There are apps out there that do something very similar. Most of them use github.com/saki4510t/UVCCamera library.

I put more info and input source samples on the google drive. Just to mention that input sources could be adjusted, but they won't be able to capture full face, at least not at this moment.

[FOR HIRE] Google Ads Specialist | 5 Years Of Experience | Your Business + My Knowledge = Profit,"Hey 👋

My name's Marco, and over the past 5 years I've generated roughly 7 Million USD in Return of Ad Spend for my clients ― ranging from established e-commerce stores to divorce lawyers, real estate companies &amp; digital marketing agencies.

I've met a lot of my old clients on Reddit &amp; thought it'd be time to make myself seen on here once again, helping your business scale beyond ***that*** annoying brick that's been hindering your growth with previous campaigns.

**But Marco, what** ***can*** **you do for me ?**

It's quite simple, really...

Setup, manage &amp; create campaigns that scale ✔️

Strategically improve your ROAS ✔️

Reduce your Cost per Conversion ✔️

Provide you with countless AdWords &amp; Landing Page CVR Strategies ✔️

Google Tag Manager &amp; Analytics Setup/Management ✔️

Outrank your competition even if their ad spend is higher ✔️

Creation of Ad copies &amp; headlines that *sell* ✔️

Provide you with an ability to quit every month if you're not satisfied ✔️

Help you get going on other PPC platforms (Amazon, Facebook, Instagram, Bing) ✔️

**White Label** **PPC** for **Digital Marketing Agencies** ✔️

...and if that's not enough, insomnia makes sure I'm around for my clients in EST &amp; MST even while I'm in Germany!

**Results &amp; Case Studies**

Comfortably look through some of my results [here](https://ppcsauce.com/results/) &amp; read a short case study [here](https://ppcsauce.com/results3/a-natural-case-study/) !

If there are any questions, such as ""have you previously done work for businesses in the industry of XYZ"" ― shoot them at me!

**How much will it cost me?**

The concept of both hourly &amp; percentage of monthly ad spend has never quite made sense to me as a pricing structure, every client is different &amp; has different needs. However, I'm not exactly planning to be homeless which is why I charge a fixed monthly fee based on overall budget &amp; performance expectation ranging from $600 to $1200 ― a fee that'll appear smaller &amp; smaller with every month ;-) .

More information can be found: [👉](https://emojipedia.org/backhand-index-pointing-right/) [here](https://ppcsauce.com/pricing/) .

**Sounds good?**

Feel free to contact me via Reddit or the many ways available on my website.

Best regards &amp; stay healthy,

"[FOR HIRE] Music Producer | Custom Music for Artists, Adverts, Content Creators, and more! With a bonus! Contract included.","**\[BONUS IS ONLY THIS WEEK, BUY ONE GET ONE FREE\]**

 Hello Redditors!  


Are you an artist that's struggling to find and develop their own sound? Listened to thousands of beats and still can't make your choice? Here to help.

Are you a content creator and do you want your own music to avoid copyright issues? Are you a streamer and want to step up your game? Let's make an album, share it with your fans, monetize it, use it as you wish, and don't worry about getting hit with copyright strikes ever again!

Do you just want to publish some songs under your name? Let's make it happen!

After producing music for 5+ Years, and after working on 600+ Songs (Yes, you read that right) I decided to offer my music here too!  
My journey began in middle school, totally randomly, and turned into a hobby that I'm trying to turn into a full-time job.  
After working with over 200 various artists ( Unfortunately no industry placements..yet! ), after thousands of hours put into practice and after thousands of opinions I've heard It's safe to say I can provide industry-quality, enjoyable and entertaining songs for everyone.

I can produce all genres, mostly...excluding only Rock, and some of the examples are seen here:  
[EDM](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_mF3kyP_TKnDE5s5D5mL4NYOKU6QbIEw5g)  
[Lo-Fi](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_n9_oKu14kkHzQuYauH6kglwlPUlCsktx8)  
[Trap](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_l-KMepf_MoX-ang5E0QnE2jKteIIs6Xek)  
[Piano Mix (Multiple Genres Included)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_n9HKf6mv2ndW6xspwx6fKRCX9tygsXmw0)  
[8Bit](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_llwNDRCqKhPGYFXCrUvAM3NooPkellmnM)  
[Calm/Sad Mood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dV08a7JEb0w&amp;list=OLAK5uy_msO0_a0RK_ZXGlAK6tckLYg8d7Fduxz_U&amp;index=12)  
[Future House/Bass](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_nVjuug1_HVS1OZF1UDeD_2cKSRjODsbuU)  
[HipHop/Trap (With Vocals)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_nZea24FX64uyrU6nzWB0pWP79y7oJ7BZA)  
(Please keep in mind that all of the songs on the playlists are linked are already sold and owned by someone else, none of them are for sale as they're exclusive, also the links are not affiliated with me in any way, nor do I make any money with them!)

Depending on the genre you're aiming for, my prices vary between $15-$40/Track.

For streamers and content creators I got album packs:

$80 - 10 songs \~ 30 minutes of playtime

$150 - 22-25 songs \~ 60-90 minutes of playtime

$200 - 35 songs \~ 100-130 Minutes of playtime

If you want to have an artist on your song that sings/raps that's $5/track additional.

Exclusive contracts are included with all the songs - which means you will own the song completely.

I can also help you publish them to all streaming platforms and show you how to monetize them!

The only thing I'll ask you for is to let me use them as my portfolio afterward, other than that you can claim them however you want!

My prices can be negotiable, feel free to let me know what you have on your mind.

Feel free to DM Me if you want to see my freelance profile with proof of 450+ orders and 270+ reviews avg 4.9/5 stars!

Feel free to ask me any questions too!

Looking forward to working with you!

Ordo aims to enhance the K-12 school experience with every student's favorite class period: lunch time! We partner with local caterers to deliver fresh, individually-wrapped lunch to schools every day of the week. It’s free for schools, cost effective for parents, and great for students. It enables schools to get rid of their kitchens and reclaim the space, order &amp; pay online, etc. Imagine getting a salmon fillet, rice, and veggies for just $5.50 at lunch. Incredible, right?

Ordo is launching at 3 schools this year, so we’re looking for a Principal Engineer to build our initial ordering platform, infrastructure, and products. In July, we closed a seed round from [Uncommon Capital](https://uncommoncapital.vc/) &amp; [Detroit Venture Partners](https://www.detroit.vc/), so we’re fully funded and ready to move fast 🏃‍💨.

Collaborating with the founding team, you will create a platform that reflects Ordo’s mission of making school lunch awesome. Since you’ll be the first engineer at the company, this is also your vision to share and improve upon. Ordo is still an early stage venture, and it is in need of an enthusiastic and determined leader to give it the framework to succeed. 

**Responsibilities**

* Work closely with the CEO and Product Lead
* Build a platform that is user friendly for everyone involved: students, parents, teachers, school administration, and our caterers
* A lot of PWAs and iOS development
* Hire a few talented engineers to work with you

**Required Skills and Experience:**

* 3+ yrs experience as a Full Stack Engineer
* 2+ yrs experience building iOS apps and/or PWAs
* 1+ yrs experience at a startup / building stuff from scratch
* User focused: track record of engineering slick products that users love.
* Love to build: you’ll be writing a lot of code yourself until you hire more people to work with, so you have to be comfortable with getting in the weeds
* Comfortable with starting from scratch: you’re kicking off the repo, so you’ll have to do your own project setup, devops, etc to get everything going
* Well-versed in React, Swift, AWS and whatever else is necessary to build for us
* Familiar with Figma &amp; other common design tools that our product lead will be using to share designs, specs, and other assets.
* If you don’t meet all the requirements listed, but still think you’d be the perfect fit for this role, please reach out to us.

* Competitive Salary ($150k+, based on experience)
* Generous stock options (5%+, based on experience)
* Health benefits package
* Working on your own schedule (100% remote)
* A fun environment where work-life balance is valued
* A chance to change the High School experience forever

[Hiring] Looking for graphic design professionals or hobbyists to participate in a user study by answering questions on prototype Q&amp;A sites,"I'm a PhD candidate at the University of Manitoba studying how interface design can be used to engage people with an online community and to see how such interventions affect people of different genders. We are looking for people 18 years old or over who identify as graphic designers or who do graphic design work professionally or as a hobby who would be interested in participating in a user study. The study can be conducted in English and/or in French.

Over 10 days, the study participant will be asked to use two different prototypes for a mock question and answer site about graphic design software. We ask the participant to use the prototypes daily, answering at least one question a day. Participants will use each prototype for 5 days, each followed by a questionnaire. Before we start the study, we will schedule a meeting (estimated 60 minutes max) to explain the study in detail, and at the end, there will be another interview (estimated 90 minutes max) where we will discuss the participant's experiences. The participant doesn't have to use a camera during our meetings, but they do have to speak (unfortunately, we can't use a chat system).

The entire study will last about 10 days and participants will have free access to the prototypes during that time. The meetings will occur over teleconferencing software, and participants will use a standard web browser to access the prototypes and other study material (however, the prototypes have only been tested in Chrome on a desktop/laptop computer; JavaScript needs to be enabled).

Participants will receive $25 CAD (converted to requested currency) at the start of the study, and $125 CAD following the second interview. Participants may withdraw from the study at any time during the study and retain any compensation received at the point of withdrawal.

We are trying to get the perspectives from a diverse set of participants. Everyone who fits our above-mentioned criteria can participate, but we enthusiastically encourage women and non-binary people to get in touch. I want to assure potential participants that you do not have to be an expert graphic designer, but only have knowledge about graphic design software.

If you are interested, have any concerns about eligibility or would like more information, feel free to contact me by direct message. I'm also happy to answer questions and provide more detail in the comments. Feel free to share the study with other people!

"[For Hire] Marketing, especially Instagram and Google","[For Hire](https://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/search?q=flair_name%3A%22For%20Hire%22&amp;restrict_sr=1)

My name is Zack Frederick and I started doing marketing several years ago as I began my first digitally focused business, realising very quickly that the difference between me and the next John Doe wasn’t the product but the presentation and the outreach. So I set about, by trial and error, learning how I could sell more than John Doe. It wasn’t long before I realised I was very good at the marketing aspect, and I didn’t really like things like warehousing and distribution. So here I am.

Today I’m most interested in building reports, designing paid campaigns and helping with Instagram. I stray away from Twitter, Bing and other smaller mediums as I lack the hours in those areas to do them justice.

*I’ve compiled a few free tips for general marketing and SEO.*

Brand awareness

First off. Influencers will not magically make your website successful. You have to be your own influencer. Over my tenor, I have spent thousands on social media analysis, rebranding and learning tricks like sticking state names across American products or even changing the colour of my website depending on the demographics of my audience. Spoilers, guys love red. Here’s an example data set. [https://imgur.com/gallery/7OHIx](https://imgur.com/gallery/7OHIx)

Last year, I ran a campaign for one of my shoe clients, and we used the pride of state consumers to grow his shoe business. I researched the best colours to use for different states and gave him a list, we put the state names across his shoes and marketed directly to them through instagram. It wasn’t long before his conversion metrics were soaring.

Here's an example report from one of my clients - [https://prnt.sc/iisqv8](https://prnt.sc/iisqv8)

Value

I have worked with a lot of musicians, a big part of them started with low view, audio-only videos. I learnt quickly that for them to achieve success they had to provide value, so i told them to create videos. They did and then ta-da, they had 4500 views when they only had 200 view music videos before. For the next step, I even got them contacts with massive digital celebrities. My proudest connection having been ‘Ninja’ during the height of his fortnite campaign, I organised the marketing behind several viral Fortnite music parodies with now millions of views.

Trend riding

Make use of trends in your business. If something is so mainstream and big, why ignore it? In the past I have made use of the political trends in the American election with trump AND hillary brands on some of my clients products, with the pro trump and pro hillary supporters wanting to sport their political beliefs no matter the cost.

I see a lot of website based businesses underuse social media with broad attempts at Facebook ads and Instagram ads, ill go to digital marketing agencies and see they either have no social following or a huge botted one. It's a terrible idea to buy followers, if you want to cut corners then you should look at buying a smaller business with a bigger social following.

Here’s the impressions from a tweet I made on the *first day* of creating a company a twitter platform and using trend riding and collaboration to grow it [https://prnt.sc/huziu6](https://prnt.sc/huziu6) 4K Impressions on one tweet in 15 minutes - we hit 80k impressions in the first day. I did this from simply mimiking the formula for success from a similiar company account, i don't want to try change the magic formula for success.

Direction

* It’s better to get one click from a Facebook group dedicated to shoes than it is to get 100 clicks to a Facebook group dedicated to Tree’s for a shoe store. It will be cheaper and about 5000% more efficient. You would lose money on the tree group. That's a rough proverb for why you shouldn't just buy facebook or instagram, youtube ads without putting in a similiar level of funding towards targetting and direction.
* I target groups through other groups. You can target parents through niche’s like Barbecue’s where the average participant is an affluent parent, you can target students through games or shoe groups where your average consumers are affluent students.

Adapt

You really do have to stay in touch with your business to know what's working and what isn't, companies like Toys R Us refused to do that and stuck with huge stockpiles of star wars toys and then they collapsed. Blockbusters where ahead of the curve for digital movies and then they refused to change, Netflix changed and Netflix won. Amazon learnt to use online selling and left companies like Tescos with financial crisis.

The big boom in marketing that I’ve seen is social media marketing, marketers can create huge social following for companies and use that platform to sell content for extremely low costs in comparison to the tens of thousands it costs to use other platforms such as radio. Social media marketing has become somewhat controversial, but it is important to always stay open minded.

Collaboration\*\* &amp; Viral content

I can not stress the importance of working with other people. Every billionaire i know of has had a mentor, every big company success story had business partners. I've had far more success in clients who have listened to me and done collaborative work with digital celebs, with a dog product business making thousands of sales when they worked with vlogger Zoella and gave her free products.

Viral content is very important because every Youtuber with over 1 million subscribers has started off big and managed to keep it big, nobody grinded and slowly rose up at an equal exponent. Hard work is fine but being consistent and mixing it up, copying the viral content of others is an easy way of bringing in secondary viewership and traffic. Pewdiepie, the biggest youtuber on the planet, started with viral horror content. Ninja, the biggest streamer, grinded for 7 years but only truly struck gold with the virality of Fortnite. So it makes sense to repeat their methods.

Key words

It is an obvious thing to say but it's neglected, key words are very important. I had a crypto business come to me and ask why their site wasnt doing very well, and i looked through it and saw they never mentioned anything beyond bitcoin. Bitcoin is a very expensive key word to market, with costs of the raw word being as high as 38$ per click. I had to bring them down to earth with harsh truths, i rewrote their entire site using SEM tools in mind - with key words and phrases like ""Altcoin exchange"" and using the names of the top 100 altcoins across the site.

SEO

Search Engine Optimisation is the name given to increasing the value and raw volume of your organic traffic. A successful website always wants as many of the most likely consumer base to encounter their product because that’s the hardest point of digital business. Your websites SEO is determined by crawlers which regularly check up on your website and update their index which is later used by an algorithm to order results when someone ‘googles’ something.

Today I’m going to be talking you through some key points about SEO that I personally audit for businesses.

Domains

Https://Www.Example.Com is an example of something we call a ‘root domain’ which is made up of protocol (https://) subdomain ([www](http://www/).) domain name (example) and top-level domain (.com). These are the basic parts. It’s important that the protocol is the best and safest it can be or else google will punish you. It’s also important your domain name and top-level domain are appropriate and readable. The words used in your subdomain can also affect how customers interpret your website, websites can be named after their market base for easy marketing. In addition, the age and previous registrations of your domain matter. It’s important these factors are appropriately considered in your website. Be minimal with subdomains.

Targeting

Google knows where it’s users are and what they’re using from their browser data, IPs and MACs and then matches them with websites in their areas or appropriate to searches. Ever since the infamous 2016 update ‘Possum’ it is not something you can ignore. Even jobs based websites had to use the meta data ‘Jobs Schema’ (from 2017 onwards) to tell google where your website was focused. Location specific landing pages matter. You have to pay credence to DNS (domain name server) and Glue to keep TTL (time to load) and mobile in mind, especially with more mobile users than ever. CMS (customs) is also part of this discussion: themes and plugins are a factor in Google’s ranking. One way to improve TTL is through CDN’s and we have to consider how we approach them to rank better. Sometimes, you might face penalties and there are ways to know; that’s a little too hard to explain here but PM me for more.

Content

**Nobody loves a book more than google.** Robots will read all your website, even the stuff humans don’t bother with. Things like duplication will annoy Google who doesn’t like reading things twice. CTA’s (buttons basically) have to go somewhere nice and if they don’t work properly google will punish you. Human biases are important too. The user experience will effect their retention and Google will clock that. There’s also lots of minor things that can stack up: Filenames (help you rank on Images) Thin content (Google sees it as lazy) phrase diversity (spamming key words is noticed) and URL structures too! Make sure your in and outbound links are healthy as well as having keyword mapping where you assign the correct words to the right pages. Make sure your anchor texts (viewable when linking) are descriptive yet succinct. And finally: link velocity, a healthy eco system of link building is important to longevity and renewed SEO.

Technical Stuff.

Consistent anchor elements are important to prevent 404s. Don’t use abbreviations with naming files and folders. Limit use of dates for file folder names. Your site architecture has to be simple and close to the root domain so the click depth isn’t too great! Links to and from your site can’t be dead ends, and use breadcrumbs! Be wary of canonical issues from similar content across multiple URLs. Treat Cookies and Session IDs properly, privacy laws are ever changed and mismatching them can be dangerous. There’s lots more to go into like header status codes, site maps, GSC Crawl Errors but Reddit has a text limit so I’ve deleted some of my post.

**Who am I?**

I am an experienced full-time freelance **Content Writer, Copywriter, and SEO Specialist** with over 9 years of experience and a background in digital marketing and communications.

**My Services Include:**

**SEO (Can be one-time or long term. My clients are usually on monthly retainers)**

* **Keyword Research &amp; Content Strategy: $400 -** This is usually the first step I take in every SEO campaign. There’s no point in creating content for topics that nobody is looking for nor for an audience that isn’t profitable to your business. I’ll help you identify the best keywords to build your campaign and content around. Aside from finding the right keywords, I’ll help you strategize which keywords to go for first, which ones to prioritize, and which ones to center campaigns around. My content strategy deliverables utilize **Ahrefs** and **Clearscope**. For each article, I'll prepare a comprehensive page outline with SEO-centric features such as structured data, meta tags, and internal linking suggestions.
* **Technical SEO: $250 -** I'll run several SEO audits and recommend + implement suggested actions for each technical issue I come across on your website. (these deliverables integrate with Screaming Frog, Ahrefs, GA, Moz and are mostly automated).
* **Content Creation (Writing): $400 -** My content services are focused on SEO and creating content that helps your web pages rank high organically in Google. This includes writing and structuring the content on your website. My writing fees for this type of content are $0.10 per word. This amounts to about **$100 per 1000 word article** ($400 for 4 articles).
* **Link-Building: $1000 (5 backlinks x $200) -** Link building is an essential element of SEO, and it's easy to get wrong. When trusted to the wrong person or team, a link-building campaign can prove ineffective or downright disastrous. I am an experienced backlink outreach person that has amassed a huge network of blog owner contacts over the last year to ensure you're getting your money's worth. Pricing starts at **$200-350 per link** (based on various factors).

**NOTE:** *I can write up to 10 or more articles a week!!!!*

Health &amp; Fitness | Digital Marketing |Entrepreneurship | Finance | Fashion | Real Estate | Lifestyle &amp; Travel | Cannabis &amp; CBD | Translation and language-related articles | Pets |Motivational/Inspirational articles | Relationships | Beauty &amp; Style | Sports | Technology | Web development | Gaming (Game Guides, updates, etc.) | Law | ***and more...***

**Who am I?**

I am an experienced full-time freelance **Content Writer, Copywriter, and SEO Specialist** with over 9 years of experience and a background in digital marketing and communications.

**My Services Include:**

**SEO (Can be one-time or long term. My clients are usually on monthly retainers)**

* **Keyword Research &amp; Content Strategy: $400 -** This is usually the first step I take in every SEO campaign. There’s no point in creating content for topics that nobody is looking for nor for an audience that isn’t profitable to your business. I’ll help you identify the best keywords to build your campaign and content around. Aside from finding the right keywords, I’ll help you strategize which keywords to go for first, which ones to prioritize, and which ones to center campaigns around. My content strategy deliverables utilize **Ahrefs** and **Clearscope**. For each article, I'll prepare a comprehensive page outline with SEO-centric features such as structured data, meta tags, and internal linking suggestions.
* **Technical SEO: $250 -** I'll run several SEO audits and recommend + implement suggested actions for each technical issue I come across on your website. (these deliverables integrate with Screaming Frog, Ahrefs, GA, Moz and are mostly automated).
* **Content Creation (Writing): $400 -** My content services are focused on SEO and creating content that helps your web pages rank high organically in Google. This includes writing and structuring the content on your website. My writing fees for this type of content are $0.10 per word. This amounts to about **$100 per 1000 word article** ($400 for 4 articles).
* **Link-Building: $1000 (5 backlinks x $200) -** Link building is an essential element of SEO, and it's easy to get wrong. When trusted to the wrong person or team, a link-building campaign can prove ineffective or downright disastrous. I am an experienced backlink outreach person that has amassed a huge network of blog owner contacts over the last year to ensure you're getting your money's worth. Pricing starts at **$200-350 per link** (based on various factors).
* **OTHER SEO SERVICES -** SEO audit (can be one-time or monthly), content marketing, email marketing, Google ads, site speed optimization, site security optimization, online reputation management, etc.

**CONTENT WRITING &amp; COPYWRITING**

*(All SEO-optimized &amp; Copyscape approved content).* I use ahrefs, Clearscope, Copyscape, and SEMrush writing assistant when writing.

**NOTE:** *I can write up to 10 or more articles a week!!!!*

**I mostly write about:**

Health &amp; Fitness | Digital Marketing |Entrepreneurship | Finance | Fashion | Real Estate | Lifestyle &amp; Travel | Cannabis &amp; CBD | Translation and language-related articles | Pets |Motivational/Inspirational articles | Relationships | Beauty &amp; Style | Sports | Technology | Web development | Gaming (Game Guides, updates, etc.) | Law | ***and more...***

[For hire] [Creative writer] I write short stories and mini-blogs on creativity and game design.,"Stories kindle our exploratory impulse. Our minds are primed for discovery, and stories create worlds of various complexity from where, ideally, we will come back with bits of knowledge.

We're more inclined to give attention to something if we are told a story about how it came to be and what it wants.

... except for Tetris and Chess. They'll always be great without packaging them into convoluted back-stabbing political dramas.

My name is Alexander, and I love creative and copy writing that unravels through short and sweet prose. Not much point in being a writer if you're not engaging in wordplay shenanigans. I'm currently freelancing as a storyteller while also sprucing up my design and branding skills.

My work includes:

- Two multi-platform indie games.

- Lighthearted marketing quips

Otherwise, 11 cents per word is a good negotiation starter. The more complex the project, the more I'll want to contribute.

[For Hire] I will teach you how to start an Infinitely Scalable Side-hustle: Service Arbitrage," **Hello everyone!**  
If you clicked on this you're probably **interested in starting a side-hustle**, or you're just bored and scrolling through Reddit, but either way, 

This is not a pyramid scheme, I am not trying to sell you my course, push my affiliate links, or anything similar, what I'm offering is 1 on 1 coaching.

Then **what is this?** 

 **Arbitrage**, in general, is the practice of buying something to resell immediately at a profit. 

 **Service arbitrage doesn’t buy and sell products. You will be selling services for profit*****.*** This trade is possible by getting a client and outsourcing the job for a lower price to other freelancers. Although the concept is easy to understand, there's a lot more behind it to be learned in order to successfully start.

**An example:**  
**Person A is looking to get cover art done for his song and is offering $80.**   
**You find and contact person B who is doing cover arts for $40, and make an offer to Person A.**  
**You connect the both, Person A pays you $80, you pay person B $40, take $40 profit, and everyone's happy!**

Sounds good, doesn't it?

It's not easy as it seems.   
You need to have connections with other freelancers that will be your go-to for arbitraging.  
You need to learn how to present yourself, negotiate deals with potential clients and how to upsell.   
You need to learn where to search for clients, what niches to go for, what should your return on revenue be, and more...

**And I'm here to teach you all of that, 1 on 1, screen sharing, and going through everything!**

**I promise not to try to upsell you anything.**

How much **income** can this generate **per month?**

Well, there are no rules, anywhere from a hundred dollars to a couple thousand, my **best month was** around **$2000**, and my **first month was $200** **doing almost nothing!**

**This all sounds scammy can't you just make infinite money doing this on your own, why would you want anyone to pay you for this?**

I would agree with you, if I were to see this, I'd totally be like ""yeah, this Is a scam"" but let me prove you wrong, and not really, you can't generate *""infinite income""*, and I'm at a point where this is totally passive now, having a Virtual Assitant doing orders for me, so why wouldn't I help someone out?  


# How about this? - I offer a full refund after 31 days If I Don't teach you everything and you don't land a sale + You're protected with PayPal Buyer Protection, so think about it again.

Last week I mentioned I will take only 5 people to teach! I took 4 and one is Already done and started, so there are two more spots left!

And how much does this **cost?**

Only one payment of **~~$60 (€50)~~** **now only $50 (€45)!**

[For Hire] Your blockchain project needs a whitepaper. I can write it for you.,"Hi,

Crypto investors are always on the lookout for innovative decentralized products with groundbreaking experience. Before crypto investors buy into a project, they tend to look at the whitepaper. They want a whitepaper that is professional, meaning that the words and graphics have to scream of professionalism. I have experience in drafting whitepapers, and I know that most potential crypto users fancy a whitepaper with two professional colors like white and blue. They also seek for a whitepaper that speaks about the problems that the blockchain-based platform is solving. Why is the platform different? What innovations is it bringing? What is the security architecture? Why won't the founders carry out a rugpull in the future? What is the utility of the token? What are the use cases? What is the marketing strategy? These and more have to be discussed in the whitepaper.

I can write and design your whitepaper. This is a link to the recent whitepapers I made.

[For Hire] Professional Spanish Translator / Game and Software Localization. Hit me with your largest project.,"###BACKGROUND###

You can read detailed info about my work at [MY WEBSITE](https://www.forsetiwriter.com/index-en/)

I'm an ESL (English as a Second Language) Teacher from Mexico City. My native language is Spanish and I've spoken English for about 16 years.

  
###REDDIT TESTIMONIALS###

I've already worked for several reddit users (I can provide you via PM some info about the projects I've participated in, if you require it) included:

* Translation and content validation [for DefinedCrowd.](https://www.reddit.com/r/testimonials/comments/8ewrmq/pos_uforseti99_super_responsive_dedicated_spanish/)  
* Translation of Coffee Crisis game [for MegaCat Studios.](https://www.reddit.com/r/testimonials/comments/8gr485/uconsistentcatthings_great_client_answered_all_my/)


*****

###EXPERIENCE###

I was part of the Spanish localization team for the game ""Katawa Shoujo"" 4 years ago. It was a big project of **around 300k words** (roughly the Lord of the Rings trilogy).

Locally, I've translated manuals and documents assigned by the Institute I work at.

Professionally, I've worked as an ESL teacher for 7 years in a private institute and 1 year at two public primary schools.

At reddit I've already translated brochures, a short kids book, several videogames, some webpages and other content.

###SERVICES###

English =&gt; Spanish translations only.

Payment is through paypal, 50% upfront. These rates are **REDDIT EXCLUSIVE!**.

* Literary Translation (Fiction): Starting at $0.06/word. Price is low, but make no mistake, I've never been a fan of sloppy work. Your translation will be thoroughly checked.  

* Literary Translation (Non-Fiction): Starting at $0.06/word depending on complexity.  

* Game and Software Localization: Starting at $0.06/word depending on complexity and length. I have a programming background, so editing directly on scripts, testing, and stuff is not really a problem for me.

You can find more information [at my site](https://www.forsetiwriter.com/services/). If you send me an e-mail, please specify you found out about me at reddit to get the starting rate of $0.06 USD.

###CONTACT INFO###

[For Hire] Pinterest Management for $300 Per Month – Get Valuable Traffic From Pinterest,"Hey guys,

If you're looking for ways to grow your website traffic, Pinterest is a great place to start. Unlike Facebook and Twitter, it's still fairly easy to drive traffic to your website from Pinterest. And if you put in enough work, you can get valuable traffic from this platform. 

I'm offering Pinterest Management for $300 per month. Under this package, I'll set up your Pinterest account and create well-optimized boards (if you haven't already). Then I will create and publish 5 beautiful pins every day (6 days a week) to your Pinterest account.

I'm also an SEO, so I know how to craft the perfect titles and meta-descriptions, using keywords naturally without overdoing it, and stuff. And no, I'm not just saying that.

Take a look at this screenshot: [https://paste.pics/34f57db267f81d2de33ae39369833738](https://paste.pics/34f57db267f81d2de33ae39369833738)

I started working on this account in January this year, and the growth has been steady. When I started, the account was getting around 100 visits per day on average, now we're at over 600+ visits per day. Another account that I'm handling has shown decent results. Traffic has grown from 50 visits to 100 visits per day in 2 months. 

Of course, your niche and/or business has to be Pinterest-friendly in order for this to work. And if your account is brand new, it's gonna take at least a few months to see decent results. I can't guarantee results overnight. This is a game of patience and persistence. 

If you're interested in the services, please reach out to me via DM or chat. I'd be happy to work with you and grow your business.

Physical product  development requires dedication, intuition, and intelligent task  management. I am a product design engineer, a project planner, and a  doer. I will take on 3 challenges that every great entrepreneur like  yourself face during the initial stages:

📝 I have an idea, how should I proceed? How can I plan and execute?

📝 What functions are critical to functions and quality, and how do I implement them in the product releases?

📝 How do I ensure timely deliveries to customers without affecting the product development cycle?

1. Project plan 📈
2. House of quality💎
3. Conceptualization and 3D design💻
4. Engineering analysis (FEA and CFD)🚧

6. Prototyping and production release🚀

[For Hire] One-Stop-Shop for All Your Writing Needs.,"We’ve all been there, right? You are looking for content with a punch, content that draws in the reader, content that is informative and devoid of fluff, but what you get is substandard, rehashed, and superficial content. Heartbreaking, right? Well, this is where I get in. Need content that is well researched, provides value, and converts? I’m your go-to person.

 I am a top-rated freelancer with a strong sense of discipline, a penchant for pushing myself to the limits, and near military discipline when it comes to meeting deadlines. I strive to deliver work that is interesting, rich in information, captivating, and with a touch of creativity. My 3 years plus as a content writer has contributed immensely to my expertise and by extension a long list of satisfied clientele. I do not compromise on quality; I understand that quality work is the rule rather than the exception and always strive to deliver highly researched content. 

I mostly provide website content, articles, link building, product description, SEO, and blog posts and can do so on most topics you can think of. 

You don't have to break the bank to work with me as I offer competitive rates and I've often been told that the value I deliver is unmatched ($0.05 per word). To give you an indication; the content I provide is often resold by agencies from across the globe at two-three times the rate I charge.

You can hire me for most types of writing jobs. I also offer clients a complete content solution which includes adding images to articles, embedding internal or external links in content, uploading blog posts to your website, managing your social media accounts, writing and distributing press releases, performing keyword research and analyzing your competitors, working on research projects, or improving previously written content.

"[Hiring] (Online) I need to remove a Li-ion battery from a device, and power the device using the battery pinheader with a fixed output power supply.","I have a requirement to place a power supply INSIDE an LTE modem (instead of powering it externally via micro-usb).  This modem has a small 5000mah battery installed that I will be removing, and I'd like to power the board using the same pinheader.  The battery uses 6 pins (2 for power, 2 for ground, and 2 for i2c).  When I apply 4v to the pinheader, the battery indicator on the modem cycles on and off a few times, but it doesn't actually turn on.  I think this is because it doesn't see a battery attached via i2c, so it shuts itself down.  

I just need someone to help me ""spoof"" the board so that it thinks there's a battery attached.  I do not have the schematic for the board, so we'll have to get a little creative.  I don't know how to apply a budgetary number to this, so I'll just throw out $300.",forhire,1.0

Maybe you're concerned about shipping, or how to get started. Maybe you don't know how to get your feet wet.

Maybe you want to sell crystals, but don't know where to source them in bulk, etc. I can help talk about ideas for your shop.

What I can offer, I'll be offering the basics most people need to know.

Ideas for a shop name.

Ideas for a shop banner.

Ideas for a profile picture/shop logo.

Some tips on taking product pictures.

Shipping/packaging advice.

Tips like using a PO box so you don't have to give out your real address.

As well as using your shop name for the shipping name, so you keep your personal name safe.

Or tips like signing up with a email specifically for your etsy shop, so customers don't see your personal email.

Responding professionally to customers, and Karen's.

The importance of using a tape gun to tape labels, or a label printer.

Product pricing, and the problem many new shops have with their pricing.

These small tips, and tricks are something I can offer you, along with other advice for your shop. If you have a idea for a shop let's talk! Let's figure it out.

Hi,

I am a solopreneur with a unique opportunity for you. I have been trained in the end-to-end process of developing Kindle assets to generate monthly income from Amazon Kindle. I am offering this to a few people in order to grow my ghostwriter portfolio. 

What my offer includes:

- A hot niche that is aimed to quickly get your title to the top sellers list on Amazon Kindle. I will let you choose from a list I have already compiled. These topics have confirmed sales ranks of 5,000 to 50,000 meaning your title should sell between 3 to 30 copies a day. They have all been tested and validated. 

- written strategy for success through promoting your title and growing your Kindle business every month

- Follow up support from myself at every step of the way

If you are interested in hiring me as your Ghost Writer the process is simple. I will charge an aquisition/contact fee of $99. This includes all of my services. I will reserve the right to display your link in my portfolio for future customers. I will also hold a 10% royalty. 

If those are agreeable to you I'm ready to get two titles started immediately. Once we square away the payment and e-sign the contract, you will be given a topic list to choose from. Once selected I will produce the title and have it edited within seven to ten days. At that point we will launch the sales process and you will upkeep the month to month housekeeping and profit share payment due to me every 30 days.  

I am only taking on two for this go round. After the two have been secured I will create a waiting list for others so please reach out. 

Look forward to working together and creating multiple income streams for folks like us. Together we conquor, divided we fall.

* You're looking to switch industries/positions and aren't sure how best to communicate your skills and experiences
* You're looking to apply to an internal position and want to put your best foot forward

Whatever the reason may be, hiring a professional can save you time, money, and mental stress (just ask my clients!).

"[For Hire] Well-organized, intuitive, and fast GUI","Hello,

I will make a well-organized GUI for you. It will be intuitive and all user actions would be responded to. I would be using Qt so it would be very fast too.

Here's a **VIDEO SAMPLE** of one of my recent works: https://old.reddit.com/user/aoe2map/comments/ncrxcw/wellorganized_intuitive_and_fast_gui (this GUI cost a total of **$110**)

#### **DISCORD: CryptoImplementer#3718**

My rates are transparent, here's a breakdown--

1) Every GUI element-- button, tab, label, etc would cost $2. For example, the key selection in the linked video has 3 tabs. The first tab has two elements, one a spinner and another a button (""generate""). The other two tabs have a single file selector each. There are also two labels- ""Key"" and the one at the bottom. And one label each for the filename. This would be a total of 11 elements, costing $22.

2) Every action would be $3. For the ""Dump intermediate states"" checkbox, a click calls a backend function to receive the intermediate directory, and updates the frontend with its value. Thus there are two actions and the cost would be $6. Similarly the key selection interface costs $9. 

3) Customisations would be extra charge I would tell you in advance.

The total cost for the entire linked GUI was $110 (Feel free to contact me for the exact calculation). Typically I work about 3 hours on this work and would deliver something like this GUI in 2 days (based on availability). 

The GUI would run on both windows and Linux. (But I will guide you through steps only for one platform of your choice). An additional platform out of the two would be an additional $5. To guide you to run it on Mac, I would charge you an additional $10. (I might also try to get it to run on Android but I don't own an Android phone).

I am only noting charges for GUI work. You can do the backend work yourself or we can discuss a payment for the backend work.

Contact me on discord by adding me **CryptoImplementer#3718** or by PM (reddit message, not chat) here on reddit. For now I only take payment using zelle so please pardon me if you do not live in the US. (or let me know if you have any alternative quick payment methods in your mind)",forhire,1.0

No matter how you're feeling, I will do my very best to cheer you up and even have serious, honest discussions with you. Think of me like a pocket jester/friend.

"[For Hire] SEO Content writer and editor for blog posts, articles, reviews, guides, and more!","Heya everyone! ~

**About Me and My Experience**

I'd love to help you out by writing well-researched SEO pieces for whatever you may need them! I'm an **experienced Content Writer, Proofreader, and Editor.** I used to work in the Tech industry with a Computer Science degree, but have since left it and started freelance writing and ghostwriting. I don't have any niches at the moment as I do most of my work through researching subjects or sources provided by you, but I enjoy Cooking, Gaming, and Tech related content. My current goal is to form a few long-term gigs, expand my portfolio, and upgrade my income.

If you want to check out some of my work, visit [my portfolio](https://lordkitty.journoportfolio.com).

**What I can offer you**

* **Content Writing:** If you're looking for someone to write blog posts, articles, social media content, and other similar things, I'm your guy! It's the content I have the most experience with, but not exclusively. I do research on all subjects required and optimize content for search engines(SEO) as well. Rates of 0.05$ ~ 0.10$ per word.

* **Ghostwriting:** Similar to Content Writing, but under NDA contracts or for any other reason that would discredit me from my work. Writing is no easy task, and it takes time. So having your work not be properly credited and nulled from the portfolio is a big deal. Naturally, this makes ghostwriting more expensive. Rates of 0.10$ ~ 0.15$ per word.

* **Proofreading &amp; Editing:** In case you already have something written but need someone to take a closer look at it, It'll be my pleasure doing so. Trust me, as I know how hard and time-consuming this can be. I can fix spelling and punctuation mistakes, fix the writing flow, or even make it more appealing to read! It's all up to your needs. Rates of 0.02$ ~ 0.04$ per word.

* **Translation &amp; Localization:** Not my priority, but I've worked on a few projects translating and doing localization with Brazilian Portuguese and English. Rates of 0.10$ ~ 0.15$ per word.

* **Other:** If you feel I deserve your attention with some other similar jobs, feel free to discuss with me directly :)


**What to Expect**

Upon contact, you should first tell me what kind of work you're looking for, the subject, word estimate, and a deadline. If available, you should also provide the sources or references you want me to use for the work. With all of that, I'll give you the total cost of the job, and if you find it reasonable, we can move on to other subjects. You're getting your piece in a Google Docs URL or file, written according to your specifications and needs.

Also, please don't assume I'll take any jobs offered. I reserve the right to refuse anything I find to be unreasonable for my work schedule. If I am to take a request from you, I will let you know in a direct manner.

**When to Expect**

That is up to several factors. First, I'll reply as soon as I can, but timezones can affect that. If you need something written as fast as possible, I'd have to check if I have other priority jobs. If I'm available, I can rush your job, but naturally, it'll cost more. Research time and sources provided are also taken into consideration when talking about the turnaround. With all that said, if you expect competent work within a reasonable timeframe, 1000 words in 24 hours is a great general rule of thumb.

**How to Contact**

Contact will be primarily through Reddit before moving on to another platform. I'll provide another platform for communication if I take your offer. **Reddit Chat is very buggy**, and often it doesn't work for me, so if at all possible, **avoid using it and send me a PM.**

**Payment**

Payment should be done through [PayPal](https://paypal.com/). If you require a big project that'll take several days of my exclusive attention, I expect a deposit upfront for a percentage of the total cost.",forhire,1.0

[For hire] Report on the freelance industry in 2021,[deleted],forhire,1.0
[For Hire]A kick-ass writer who has run out of asses to kick!,"Imagine what your business could do if it made 100,000$ in sales every day. AHHH, doesn't that sound cute? Well, keep imagining because statistical probability says that's not reality right now.

But before you get offended and break a head, hear me out when I say “when turning our imaginations into possibilities, we have to confront the present realities”.

And your present realities probably leave you wondering why your products don't sell enough, and your site struggles to reach its full potential?

Well, it's as simple as this - **Your writing isn't cutting it.**

**And if the message you are sending isn't getting properly relayed to your customers, then it doesn't matter how great your products are.**

I'm here to help you change that.

I will engage your audience, excite your clients, and most importantly - **Sell.**

My background in psychology and business/marketing combined with my creative skills and experience has provided me with the skills to deliver weaponized content that converts. I understand the process that drives the human desire to buy, and I know it sounds evil but I know how to exploit that desire.

With my services, you can be tension-free and (hopefully) see your aspirations turn to complete reality.

**I write high conversion persuasive content for these areas:**

* Sales and Advertising
* Email Marketing Campaigns
* Ads
* Websites Content
* Product Descriptions
* Sales Script
* Unique Content ( 100% Plagiarism free )
* Landing Pages
* About me
* Product Descriptions
* SEO Optimization

What you'll receive:

* **Expertly Crafted writings** that appeal to your customer's deepest desires and have them throwing money your way
* **Grow your brand** with engaging copy that sparks your customer's imagination and creates brand excitement
* **Top-notch customer service** with fast communication, quick deliveries, and unlimited revisions

Still not convinced?

Think about it. You're still reading, right?

Your audience will do the same, and **the more they read, the more they'll buy.**

**Here is a link to my short portfolio, check it out:**[ **https://abdullahbinmasood.contently.com/**](https://abdullahbinmasood.contently.com/)

**And remember. If it is not in the portfolio, it doesn't mean it can't be done.**

[For Hire] Virtual Assistant,"**The minimum rate for most subs is $15/hour but I accept at least $0.3/hour**

I am offering my services as a virtual assistant. My rate is so low because I don't have much experience in the field and I still live with my parents. I will use 100% of this money to pay for my university. I live in a country where 0.3USD/hour is just enough to pay for a good private university monthly fee.

Whilst I don't have experience working necessarily as a VA, in the past, I had about one year and a half of an internship in a government agency plus several months as a freelancer. I have knowledge of office tools (Microsoft Word, Excel, Powerpoint, Access), and some programming languages and frameworks (Python, Java, Javascript, PHP) so I know how to do task automation and data scraping with Python and Selenium. I have also experience integrating Mercado Pago (South American organization) API into a Minecraft server to be able to process item purchases and communicate with a Flask backend. I understand how to create and manage databases using Python and PHP.

If you are interested or knows someone who might have a gig for me let me know. You can contact me over here on Reddit or at my Discord: 4ng314#9083.",forhire,1.0
