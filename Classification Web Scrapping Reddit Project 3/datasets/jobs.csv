Advice on when to submit 2-weeks (or more) notice,"Hello all,

I wanted advice on when to submit my 2-weeks notice. I am currently employed for a set term that expires in a month. I have heard nothing but bad things regarding the organization's budget (we currently don't have one defined even though we have been in a new fiscal year for awhile), and when asked if my term will be extended (as was the agreement with my previous manager who has since left during COVID), my current manager responded that there is still not a clear direction with regard to converting my position to a permanent one or extending the term. I am directly employed by the organization (not contracted), and I have no shortage of work to complete: I have enough to keep me occupied for the next 1-2 years. My performance reviews have always been positive, and my productivity has received no complaints from customers or management. However my current organization is very large and bureaucratic (think government work): many things such as extending term employees don't happen until the last minute, and oftentimes they get missed. We've also been hit with budget problems since COVID, like most other organizations, and had to layoff a few people and remove/reduce some services offered by our department. 

I have a good relationship with my previous manager, and s/he recommended that I apply to the organization where they are currently working . My previous manager wants me to start at this new organization ASAP, and  has given me a verbal offer after 2 panels of interviews, with the understanding that the more formal offer will be coming from this organization's HR department. From my understanding, this position requires a background check that can take 2-3 weeks to process, and the future manager wants me to begin the process ASAP. This new position will be challenging, but comes with a 10% better salary and better overall benefits.

The question: when is a good time to submit my notice to best guarantee future stability? Should I submit my notice after I receive the formal written offer letter?

\- Currently I have a lot of knowledge-sharing to do if I leave, and I want to do my best to retain good terms with my current employer. My current manager and co-workers have been very much not engaged in the work I do (one of the reasons for me leaving).

\- Even though I am a term employee, my position is still eligible for unemployment if they decide not to extend the term, which would help be a ""safety net"" until my new position is secured. If I leave voluntarily, there is no unemployment benefit. I do have about 3 months of savings in reserve, as well as my retirement.

\- I'm not worried about background check findings: I have a speeding ticket from &gt;7 years ago and a good credit score, but I've heard horror stories of when a background check returns results from someone with a similar name.

\-My future manager has a lot of work lined up for me at this new company already, and would like me to begin ASAP. The future manager also understands the desire to leave in the right way. They went out of their way to provide recommendations, advice, training, and career guidance: they are a true mentor, and I would work for this person any day of the week (including weekends).

\- I had scheduled some vacation time next week to visit family in another state. How would this impact a 2-weeks notice? Would protocol be 2 weeks + 1 week of vacation?",jobs,1.0

Omitting experience from application,"I’ve been trying to help my wife find a new job. 
She has been submitting many applications, but very few make it past the initial screening. 

I suspect one issue is she has only worked for one employer. She has been there for 18 years.  
She wound up with them through a high school work program.  
She has had several roles, the most recent she started in the middle of 2018. 

She would be happy with a somewhat entry level role, in another industry.  

I know it is ok to leave irrelevant or extraneous work history off a resume. 
However most online job portals require an application.

Negotiating salary retroactively,"I got a job in early July and I am making 47,000. The salary at hire could have been anywhere from 40,000-60,000. I am realizing that my current salary just is not cutting it for me - I could find jobs elsewhere which pay more. 

Aside from salary, I enjoy my current job. They were short-staffed for quite a while and if I were to leave it would take a long time for them to hire and train someone else. I am a good member of the team, take on high level tasks, and have received praise for my performance. 

However, I have a one-on-one meeting with my department manager in 2 weeks and am hoping to renegotiate my salary. This is where I am looking for your help.

How can I go about this? What do I say? Is this even remotely reasonable? Should I be afraid of some sort of “retaliation”?",jobs,1.0
"FIRED! (Boss said: It is not a good fit, so sorry we have to let you go!)","When I worked in Human Resources, senior management gave me the authority to approve or disapprove all employment terminations.  This was done to protect the company against lawsuits and give the staff the impression that everyone, including people who are struggling with their work, has an opportunity to improve.

In theory, there was a policy where struggling employees would get an oral warning, counseling, additional training, a written warning, and a performance approval plan before they could be fired.  And Human Resources had the responsibility to see that the manager did all those things.

This was in an office setting where nearly everyone was a highly trained college-educated professional.

Trouble was I was a one-man Human Resources Department and I would go on vacation and it seemed like nearly every time I was gone for more than a week, a rouge manager would fire an employee without any warning.  The manager would pull the employee into their office and tell them:  ""Sorry, it is just not a good fit, after thinking about it we have decided to end your employment with the company.""

I would return from vacation and find out people were fired.  The manager was unapologetic and stated he/she did not have time to counsel, train or warn employees who did not fit.  If I pushed it the manager would attempt to discredit me using advanced skills in office politics.

Is not hearing back about a background check after 15 days a red flag?,"
I applied for a front desk job in a nearby hotel, when I came in for an interview, they stated that my past experience in the food industry listed on my resume would be beneficial to them because they needed waitresses (I’m trying to get out hosting/waitressing). I said I was mainly looking for front desk jobs but they incentivized me by saying that I may get bartending training while I’m waitressing and that I could possibly switch roles to something like a front desk job or laundry attendant in 6 months. I agreed because I wanted the possibility of having free bartending training on top of everything but after the interview and applying for the background check, I didn’t hear back from them for 15 days. This really worried me because they said I should be able to start within about a week.

About a week after the interview I called back but HR was in a meeting, so I waited until the next week and left a message politely asking for the status on the background check. I finally got a call back with no explanation on the wait asking me to come in this week just yesterday after convincing myself that I didn’t get the job, but now I’m quite worried about communication on their end and if this job is even worth it. Am I overreacting? Is this a red flag about poor communication on their end?",jobs,1.0

Recruiters Taking a Long Time?,"Wednesday last week, I had interviews for two roles I really want with two different companies. The first one went well but they gave little away in terms of where I was positioned against other candidates as they were hiring direct. The second seemed to go okay but they didn’t give much away also - however apparently I “blew away” the interviewer according to the recruitment company I am going via. It seemed like an average interview so I’m not sure if I was just being flattered but he did say that out of the two candidates, I seemed to be the better option and kept asking if I would take the job at the salary he had suggested. I said yes each time. 

The second job was supposed to give me an update by the end of Friday and instead they have now said that they should have a final decision by Wednesday. What could cause recruitment to be so slow on this one?

The first job has also said that I should hear back by midweek at the latest - when do you think would be too early to chase their decision? I haven’t yet chased this role as I don’t want to come across as too pushy!",jobs,1.0

Is HR just being nice? I think the manager doesnt want to hire me anymore,"Last week the manager seemed really eager to hire me. On friday I emailed her about whether I should attend the meeting. She didnt respond. But someone else emailed me on monday with a link to the meeting. manager didnt turn up for this meeting. But I was told by the owner of the company that she was happy that I joined the meeting and she mentioned how I was coming on board. 

I had a induction meeting with HR today and I asked at the end when can I start and what do I do? They told me once my references come back i start and that they're also talking to the manager about this too. But when HR was saying we're also talking to the manager about this, he just looked abit awkward and the rest of the HR team was saying it was fine and the process takes long. But HR is usually nice.

 I'm worried the manager doesnt want me anymore because I have a massive gap in employment (she didnt ask until a week after she offered me the job, she forgot apparently), I explained. In the email she came across fine. Also on the form I said that I had IBS, I'm worried this might be the reason they might not want to hire me.",jobs,1.0

I checked the company's website and saw one of the roles they mentioned posted yesterday and it was one of the shifts they said they may have. 

My question is does this mean I did not get the job? Or since they finalized the actual time and schedule that they posted it to find other candidates?

Finding hard to get an interview after graduating college.,"Hi, so my issue is, after 7 months from graduating college I find it hard to get even just a first interview for a job. 
Now a little bit of a background: I got my Bachelor's degree in Feb 2021 but I was late by a year and passed with minimum grades. During my college days I asked if I could work part time at school but I was rejected because at that time my average grade was not high enough plus I still had a couple subjects left to give for that year. 
I have never attended seminars for our faculty nor I have ever started internships because of my grades again (my college is one of the top 5 in my country and is partner with a lot companies so students have quite the advantage if they are looking to become working students). 

After graduating college I started sending my cv online (on the official website of the company I was interested in or through those sites where you can find job offers). 

I majored in Banking, Finance &amp; Assurances so I applied for entry level jobs at banks, for internships, for graduate programmes, or even just for a secretary position (tried applying for those offers which required Bachelor's degree or higher because...you never know). 
Got my first call for an interview at a bank in April for a programme meant for new graduates but I botched it because I didn't know what to expect, was nervous and my answers were so bad.

Kept sending my cv for roles linked to my degree, got another Hirevue virtual interview after a couple of months for a risk management company. I prepared well for that one and was pretty confident I left a good impression with my recorded videos but didn't get a follow up call/email/interview.

Now as I was waiting for a feedback, during those months up until now I have even applied at fast foods and retail shops for a sales lady position because I need to earn something meanwhile but no one called. 
Applied even on my college ""stage &amp; placement"" site for internships but still no interview. 

I bought 2 books that explain how to prepare for job hunting in consulting and that has exercises that will prepare me for potential tests in a bank (changed even my CV and omitted my grades in hopes that I might get a better chance if recruiters don't know how low my grades were). 

Now I'm kinda getting almost desperate and fear I might not get a job by next year and will start going to employment agencies instead. My questions are:

- Do you guys ALWAYS write cover letters even though it is not required for a specific job? (I have never sent my CV with a cover letter). To put it simply, is a CL necessary to have a better chance in having your CV taken into consideration? My problem is I have NO EXPERIENCE so what would I even be writing in a cover letter besides being interested in the job? 

- Should I take courses to acquire new skills that companies are looking for? I have observed that most positions in the Economy field look for people who know certain IT languages such as SAP, R, etc... 
But again I don't wanna pay 1k € or more just for a certificate I'm not even sure is going to play a big part in my job research. 

-  How important is ""networking""? I have always hated the idea that I would rely on someone just to get something. I feel that would be like USING the other person and I hate being in debt of someone, plus I'm not a great conversationalist and I just mind my business.

- Which other activities should I consider doing? I've read that volunteering could prove useful in an interview and I have done 1 during this summer but I was mostly just standing there handing leaflets and taking people to their seats before a concert.
Is volunteering even THAT relevant? I didn't really acquire any useful skills, plus it was not even related to my studies.

- Set up a LINKEDIN account? Do recruiters look up their candidates online? 

- Is having a Master's degree the solution? I noticed that most look for a Master's and that's why I have been considering going back to college for that. Also a friend of mine who got his Bachelor's told me that a couple companies advised him to get a Master's since he already got as far as getting a Bachelor's. 

And lastly I'd want to add that I have once watched a webinar organized by a big bank. They were looking for students to start an internship with in November but they were not accepting people with only a Bachelor's degree because starting an internship would have meant being guided by top figures within the bank and they needed people with top grades. 
Is it really that hard to get an internship? I actually thought it was easier than being directly hired because I have always thought it was like a ""formation"" period where applicants would learn from 0.

I would really like to know what you guys think.

What's a lucrative field to get started off in as a newly graduated programmer?,"I am soon going to graduate with a Bachelor's in Engineering in Information Science. I don't want to apply to any kind of coding job that's hiring, but rather choose a field to specialise in.

Which fields are promising for the present and secure for the near future? I'm mainly focused on becoming adept at something (like web design/app dev. etc) so I can eventually freelance and collaborate with others without depending on corporate jobs to give me workloads. 

I've heard web dev is lucrative (React, JS) but my worry is, with apps like Wix and WordPress, would a React programmer be a dying demand in the near future? What are some other fields that are soon going to go obsolete to automation? And what are some fields which are going to/are booming?

just a little job marketing rant,"Hello everyone, I am just a little bit new to this subreddit. I thought I could just vent a tiny bit. For me, I've been looking for a decent job for some time now. I have a bachelor's of science in two majors, and two minors. I've been working as a data analyst and project manager for about 10 years now. But the job market has been so very tough. I've even worked with staffing companies for potential employment. The agents I work with are very good at their jobs, when I get the initial phone interview with someone from the company, it goes well. But then when I get to the zoom interview, and meet with the potential team I'd work with, they ask these very curveball questions, such as if I've ever built an entire database without using any company tools, or if I can suddenly take leadership on a project without being given any guidelines and deadlines, even if I'm the junior project manager. As a data analyst, I just report on the data, and work with a group. I don't know why so many places would advertise a data analyst, and then in the interview, want me to be a full stack developer,  and execute project manager. Another thing is I'm getting very frustrated with applying to a job, and they ask me to complete an assessment, most of the time these assessments don't have anything to do with the job advertised. I feel like it's another hurdle for people like to go through, it seems like my degree is worthless, my experience isn't enough because it seems like in the IT sphere, i needed to have 15+ years experience to even get an entry level position. To give context, I'm only 31 years old. I've even been working in college, but it still seems like it's not enough. The worst part is it seems like I'm losing my mind over these things. I work on my networking skills, I use LinkedIn and other platforms, but they seem to be useless. I feel like I've been trapped in this space for over 5 years now. I can't even seem to get any contract roles anymore. I don't want to give up, but I don't understand why it's so very difficult. It even seems like the companies are asking for more experience, will pay you less, and want you to work more hours.

Took a demotion over severance and they still took my insurance,"I can't believe I was so stupid to even stay with this sham of a greenwashed unprofitable start up.

I was so scared about being jobless and having to dig into my hard earned savings to keep afloat (live alone, i can't rely on anyone to help me in situations like this) that I took a demotion over a month's pay of severance. I didn't want to lose my insurance as well. 

They removed it anyways.

I didn't think this would happen since I very clearly asked if this would be a 'rehire' process or just a change in assignment. I have this in writing. But apparently they still removed me. And now I'm SOL because I didn't get any of my yearly exams done due to covid concerns.

I feel so deceived, used, and broken down. They lied about other things that I didn't find out until after my choice was made too.

On top of everything they did to me, this was the final straw. It's going to take all my mental fortitude (which is not that much might I add) to not quit on the spot tomorrow.

I didn't deserve this 'reassignment' (because I was strictly told not to call it a demotion when it clearly is). I worked hard to get to the entry level marketing role without a BA in marketing.

Job searching on Linkedin vs Zip Recruiter vs Indeed vs direct company site,"-Out of these 4 options, which one brings the best outcomes for interviews and/ or job offers?
- Pros and Cons of each
-Time period range when you get replies from the recruiter or hiring manager

The following is based on me searching for 3 weeks (is three weeks too short to give assesments?)

1. Linkedin- no luck,  though it's great to be able to direct message the recruiter. It seems everyone and their cousins are on this platform, I see so many applicants for all positions.
2.  ZipRecruiter- no luck at all, though I do like that they update when the hiring manager views your application.
3. Indeed - had one interview, I was given offer due to not many applicants applying for that position, but I turned it down b/c the actual duties were different than I expected.
4. Direct company site - will have one interview next week. No benefit of 1 click app or easy app since you have to fill in all the boxes yourself.

*Also what are y'all opinions on recruiting firms/staffing agencies? Currently registered with one agency, had one interview, no offers though. Plus their salary for temp to hire positions were kind of low. I read somewhere that they get a percentage from the companies they represent, so I guess it makes sense for lower wage.

Can’t find a job I like,"Brace yourself. This is a long one. 

Hey everyone, the title pretty much sums up what this post is going to be about. I just cannot for the life of me find a job that I don’t absolutely hate after a few months of it (I’ve had 5 in the past few years). 

I ended high school doing pretty well off, I decided that I wanted to be a welder in grade 9 and packed my schedule with classes that would help me achieve that. I did very well in my welding classes and achieved the highest grade in the class. The summer of grade 11 my teacher helped me get a welding job at a place that makes agricultural equipment, I continued to work there for six hours every evening through grade 12. 

By the end of my time working there I absolutely hated it for a multitude of reasons so I decided to try my hand at mechanics, seeing as though it is something I enjoyed in my free time. I found a shop that worked on tractor-trailers (semis) and was hired a couple weeks after I graduated. Well, it didn’t last long. I had no passion what so ever for heavy duty repair as it was extremely dirty, mind numbing and didn’t find any pleasure in my work. 

I returned to my original welding job and was right back where I started, and hated having to get up every day to go to a place that I despised. A couple months in I was offered a job by a co worker to build grain bins in the summer. I quit my current job on the spot even though I was two months away from the bin season started, I just could not take it anymore. 

I showed up to the first day of my new job optimistic as I’d never done anything like this before. It involved being away from home every week and busting ass like you wouldn’t believe. This is the only job so far that I have truly enjoyed. I made some great friends there that now feel like brothers to me. However it is seasonal work and comes to an end in October usually. 

My boss was pretty good about finding work for the guys he liked and wanted to keep so I found myself back welding again. This time welding corral panels for a farmer. It was alright for about a month then I seemed to hit my wall again. Absolutely hated it, hated waking up everyday and hated going to sleep with the knowledge that tomorrow is going to be the same. At this time I was offered a job a couple towns over from the former plant manager of the first place I welded at. He was now the plant manager at a different place and really talked it up. So I took it and decided to leave bins behind. That was a mistake, I showed up to work the first day and found it was the exact same bullshit I was doing at my first welding job. Couldn’t bear to go in another day and quit. I returned to my job welding corral panels for the winter. 

The second year of building bins for me was...pretty chaotic. Given that this year covid has really affected the area I live in and it was hard for the company I was contracted for to get parts delivered. One of the guys I considered a brother also turned into a real asshole. Keep in mind that bins is very similar to jobs such as the oil field and pipeline. But most of the time if your a hard worker you don’t catch much flack. Well this guy didn’t get the memo. He proceeded to crank up his huge ego and laid into me all year. I’d had a enough of it and took another job, and you guessed it, back to welding. 

This time at a company that build grain trailers. I’m now a month and a half in and I’m in the same situation as before. These type of jobs pay great but I cannot stand them, every day is still a struggle and find myself suffering borderline severe mental problems. In two days I have a trial at another company to do sign installation/decal work. I’ll still be working with my hands but this will require a different set of skills. I’m just worried that I’ll end up hating this as well, and if I do I have no idea what to do. I don’t want to keep stacking up jobs on my resume as it’s truly a bad look. Every single one of my jobs I ended up hating, I can understand having good days and bad days but when the bad days outnumber the good days 9/10 I don’t think that’s normal. Please any advice would be appreciated, I just feel like I’m spinning my wheels and sinking deeper and deeper.",jobs,1.0
Literally Nothing To Do At My New Job,"Hi guys, a month and a half ago, I’ve switched jobs to a product manager position in a bank. During the first month I’ve been doing some Onboardings with colleagues and some trainings, and since it was August and a lot of people were on holidays, I didn’t care that much about not having so much work to do.

However, everyone was telling me that September is usually a crazy month but for me is just the opposite because I have nothing to do.

In theory, I’m hired to make the strategy of a certain product not developed before, I’ve introduced it to my boss and she really liked it, but now, this campaign is on stand by due to budget limitations and I have nothing to do literally. 

Every day on our daily meetings I ask if I can help on something, and even though there is people complaining about all the work they have, they don’t want me to help, I assume it is because they need to explain me how to do it.

So, what can I do? I’m going to talk to my manager about that, but I already had a 1:1 with her 3 weeks ago and the situation haven’t improved, is it even worse, and I’m starting to feel anxiety because I feel useless. 

The other day, a friend told me that a position in her company was opened to something related with my expertise, and I’m considering now applying due to the lack of work",jobs,1.0

How professional do we have to be in the application process?,"I (GenZ/Millennial cusp) feel like things have changed somewhat with older millennials infiltrating the director and executive roles.. perhaps my current office is just extremely lax but in some application prompts, I find myself wanting to be candid. Like make jokes or side comments.. The company itself seems young judging by their reputation and media so I don’t feel entirely misguided… I just feel odd going against the stiff professional dialogue that had been hammered into us by the boomers. I feel like I want to express that I’m a human and could be a good addition to a team and that is hard to convey when you’re typing in the most formal and impersonal way. I’m not out here ripping knock knock jokes. It’s just like little comments about the field that they would probably understand, as I’m explaining my skills. I’d say it’s more personal than jokey but still unnecessary.

How to determine if a job is right for you?,"I've been on three interviews for a recruitment consultant position. They didn't really feel like interviews, they were more conversation based and transparent which I appreciate.

Now I'm trying to determine if this is something I want. I'm a very hands on person so its hard for me to figure out if I want something before I try it. I need to try before I buy if that metaphor makes any sense.

Will it be possible to ever earn a higher wage or salary based on my experience?,"I graduated college with a BA in political science. A month after graduating, I found a job as a case manager at a law firm. Because I was desperate to work and needed money, the law firm starting pay was $16 hour, M-F, 9-5. No benefits offered other than 10 vacation days per year. They didn’t want to increase my pay, despite showing hard work. When I asked about salary increase, I was told only if I stayed there long term. I eventually had to quit because I’ll be moving with my husband to another state. I plan to find work but I’m nervous that I won’t be able to find something that pays well. I know other college grads who started earning $20-$22 or even higher hour starting at a job right out of college, same degree. I messed up by choosing this law firm low paying job. But I think the experience was eye opening. I was only there for a year. 

I have had a few internships here and there. I was part of a campus club board too. I only worked a part time job for a few months before the law firm job but that’s about it for working experience.

Maybe it's because you rejected people who were willing to work and get trained on the job, and those people had to move on to different industries or leave the work force all together.

This rejection is enough to turn people misanthropic.

AMA + An insider's review of the highest paying freelance platforms,"Hello all!

I'm in the unique position of having used many different platforms for freelance work, and I've been accepted in many of the more premium/exclusive ones as well. In this post I'll review the best three I've used so far, which are Toptal, BrainTrust and 10xManagement. I've also used Upwork, Freelancer, Elance and Fiverr both as an employee and employer.

Why are those three the best? For **experienced** freelancers (they all require experience and are very hard to get accepted into), these platforms will give you the best clients, which means the best wages and the best projects. All three are also very professional and will support their talent better than a low-end freelance site. Not to say they are perfect, all of them have issues, but they're better than the current alternatives.

Let's go!

# [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/#bring-in-incredible-hackers-now)

Toptal is the biggest one of those three (maybe the biggest premium platform overall) and has the most jobs, by far. It is the most well-known of the three, and as such, they are in a dominant position in this market and they know it, so they can charge higher fees for example.

They are a typical marketplace in which, once approved, you get to see all the listings and apply to them. Because you've already been technically vetted by Toptal, clients usually won't test you, and the interviews are mostly to check communication and fit.

### Jobs

At this moment, there are [127 jobs](https://i.imgur.com/y8r7W87.png) that have been added within the last 7 days. This doesn't include jobs that require a specialization, if you include those, then it's over 150. These are serious clients that had to put in a deposit to create a job posting.

If your goal is to get hired as fast as possible, Toptal wins out here, and there is also a good diversity of contracts.

The quality of the jobs/employers vary, you can find a contract with Airbnb on there or you can find a contract with a small startup. Overall, there is a minimum standard, and you won't find a truly terrible/broke client on there, clients are vetted and must put down a deposit.

### Rates

Expect between $40-100/h for the vast majority (90%+) of roles. 

[Here](https://i.imgur.com/XBtEVd4.png) is a chart directly from Toptal that shows what a client is expected to pay per hour for their talent. If these numbers look higher than what I wrote above, that's because the talent doesn't see those rates.

In Toptal, the neither client nor the talent know each other's rate, the talent sets his own rate and the client will see the talent's rate with the Toptal fee already added on top. This varies, but generally the Toptal fee is about 50% (!) of the talent rate, so if your rate is $60, the client might pay 80-100/h for you. 


### Joining Toptal

It is pretty difficult to get accepted in Toptal, there are five steps in the interview process and some require good algorithmic knowledge, others require a lot of free time. They get hundreds of applicants per day because of how well-known the platform is.

To join, simply go [here](https://www.toptal.com/#bring-in-incredible-hackers-now) and sign up, you'll be contacted for the first step of the interview in a bit.

The first step is a simple interview to test your English and communication skills. Next, they’ll send you a codility test to complete. If you pass that, you’ll get a technical interview with an engineer, who might ask algorithmic type questions as well. After that, you’ll have a take home project to complete, and a final interview demonstrating the project you’ve built.

# [Braintrust](https://www.usebraintrust.com/join-engineer?utm_source=talent&amp;utm_medium=community&amp;utm_campaign=dc_ref)

Braintrust is the newest one here. It was founded in 2018 but it's only really starting to pick up in popularity recently. The overall process overall is fairly similar to Toptal, you go through an interview process, and once approved, you apply to positions.

They are already working with large companies such as NASA, Porsche, Deloitte, Nike etc.

One interesting quirk of Braintrust is that they are trying to make the platform more ""decentralized"", and ""talent-owned"". They have their own crypto (btrst) which launched recently, and btrst holders will be able to vote on proposals to the platform (governance), theoretically even important things like modifying the fees could be voted upon.

### Jobs

At this moment there are 40 jobs in the last 7 days. Most are development jobs, but there are also jobs for Product Management, Project Management, Designers and more, same as Toptal. There are also jobs that don’t fit into those buckets, such a communications manager, copywriter and such, so it’s still worth considering for non-traditional remote roles.

The jobs are very competitive so it’s difficult to get hired. The clients are high quality and there are a lot of approved Freelancers, some whom are very good, so you need to really stand out. I expect the balance to change soon as the platform aims to onboard more clients.



### Rates

The rates at Braintrust are pretty good. Braintrust only takes 10% from the client and 0% from the talent, so you nearly get the rate the client pays. The vast majority of roles pay between 50-150/h, although there are some outliers on both sides.

### Joining Braintrust

Simply sign up [here](https://www.usebraintrust.com/join-engineer?utm_source=talent&amp;utm_medium=community&amp;utm_campaign=dc_ref). You’ll enter a waiting list before getting interviewed. Fill out your profile as much as you can as it might accelerate the time it takes you to get an interview.

The waiting list is pretty short at the moment but that might change as the network might gain a lot of publicity soon.

As for the process itself, it’s a fairly simple one, there is an initial screening call in which your communication skills will be evaluated, a second stage in which you’ll be asked to complete a coding challenge and a third stage which is the behavioral and technical interview. The interviews are not challenging per say, however, Braintrust is very selective and thus you need your communication and technical skills to be on point.

# [10x Management](https://10xmanagement.com/)

This one is a little bit more secretive, but it is nonetheless a very good option for highly skilled freelancers and possibly the one with the highest rates overall.

The owners used to manage music talented and pivoted to manage tech talent, in a similar manner, and they’ve done so pretty successfully. For their permanent talent, they somewhat “guarantee” that they’ll find you work full-time or part-time, as they would with entertainment talent, and for that reason they have very few engineers whom are very highly qualified. If they are representing you, they will also do as much as they can to ensure you get paid by the client, up to assisting in legal matters.

They are not a marketplace per say like the other two, you don’t have access to the list of all positions, a 10x agent will contact you directly when they have an opportunity for you and you get to either accept or refuse an interview with the client for that position.

### Jobs

Due to the nature of how they work, I can’t really know how many jobs they have available, I can only know about the ones they contact me for, or sometimes they’ll ask everyone for a job that is specifically difficult to fill. My guess is they likely don’t have too many openings at a time, maybe 10-30, but they do have a lot of talent working on long-term engagement.

If you manage to become officially represented by 10x, they would generally find you enough opportunities to fill your time, but getting represented as such is very difficult. They have A-tier customers as well, such as BMW, Berkeley, Ebay, Nordstrom, Yelp etc.

However, they are moving away from that model somewhat and most of the new talent instead gets a non-exclusive contract, in which they can work on other projects too and 10x doesn’t guarantee to fill their time.

### Rates

The rates at 10x are the highest of all 3 and generally start at around 175/h. If you’re a super specialist or you have very impressive experience, you can sometimes double or even triple that. It’s also possible to get a lower rate than that, although anything under 100 would be pretty much unheard of. As for the fees, they are charged to the talent and are generally about 15% for represented individuals, and 25% for the non-exclusive folks. 

### Joining 10x Management

Joining 10x is close to impossible. They make that very obvious as they don’t even have a form to apply as talent. Essentially, they’ll be the ones reaching out to you if you’re a truly great engineer or you’re very well known.

That’s probably pretty disappointing reading this after I tell you about their amazing clients and rates...but well… there may be another way. As 10x comes from entertainment talent management, they view relationships as extremely important. So essentially, if you want to get in, you need to both be talented and know someone on the inside that can refer you and vouch for you. Check your linked in contacts properly (build them if you have a poor network), maybe you already know someone that’s part of the network..

As for the process to join the network one you’re in the pipeline, it’s a fairly simple process, you’ll have a call with the founder to ensure you have the right communication style (communication is the most important thing in 10x), and if that goes well, you’ll have another interview with an engineer. If that goes well, then you’re in, and you’ll start getting emails once in a while for potential gigs.

=========

# Ending words

There you have it. If you’ve got some experience under your belt and/or a good portfolio, give a shot to a few of these, and if you get rejected the first time, try again in 6 months. None of these platforms will reject you “permanently”, unless you do something stupid, keep studying and working hard and apply again later. Feel free to ask me anything in the comments!",jobs,1.0
"Tired of being told that I ""need to be more pushy"" or ""can't keep a conversation going"" or ""I should work in a grocery store if I get nothing""","I am 23M and I graduated from college back in May 2020 as an IT major. Still no full time job yet although my parents  are seeing people I knew from my hometown, hearing about how they are getting full time jobs already. **IF TL;DR, skip to the last paragraph.**

When I graduated in May 2020, I landed this project based position doing manual labor in data centers under this helpdesk company that lied saying it is a part time IT helpdesk job. It was in the Bay Area. I moved from New Jersey to the Bay Area in California living with family out there. I really could not stand living at home with my narcissistic parents, as you can see by my username. I would not want to be living at home unemployed during a recession with my crappy parents. However, I do regret moving out of NJ, because the job market in California is so awful based on what I am reading on this subreddit and the unemployment subreddit. Everyone I know who stayed back East is doing better than me. 

That same position gave me a contract role as a data center technician, which I was fired from after a week, because I was working a little too slow, so I pretended to go to work every day for 3 months so that my grandparents would not tell my parents. 

Got an internship doing wireless testing work (not IT work) and quitted that position after a month (quit in June), because we had to do 12 hour overnight shifts and I could not handle that and they never convert anyone to full time in that place from what I've heard. 

I am not crazy about IT, so I tried business development (both in person and remote) during the dark days of covid. Could not land anything even though I brushed my interview skills, because I don't have an outgoing personality. Tried applying to analyst roles since the beginning of 2021 and cannot land anything in person or remote, because it is a desirable oversaturated field. Now I am looking for roles dealing with law ( in person) since I have law firm experience and since law is not saturated, but sometimes I see 20 applicants for paralegal or legal assistant roles, so Bay Area jobs are still saturated.  Still haven't landed anything yet, but had a few interviews. Last week was a slow week with no interviews and only 2 rejections.

 Just a rant, my family members back out East are going crazy to me. I am tired of my narcissistic mom telling me that I have to be more pushy and my narcissistic grandmother back out East (not the one I live with) tells me how I should move back and take care of my parents forever. My mom went on a rant yesterday saying I need to ""do something"" and of course people think I am lazy. She is saying how I should go work at a grocery store. My mom is always giving the same repetitive advice over and over like telling me to send generic thank you letters. She even told me I should go in person and ask for a job, like that's going to help. I am applying to any internship as well and searching temp agencies just to get experience and to impress my parents. It seems like the longer I don't have any job, the more apocalyptic effects I am suffering through. The economy is not good and people are not understanding of this at all. I can't wait until we get our 2019 economy back eventually.",jobs,1.0

I’m feeling like nobody is recognizing my degree,"I recently graduated this past May with a degree in Theme Park Management. The degree itself is a bachelors in science. It’s a pretty rare degree and about 10-15 people a year end up graduating with it. I’m really proud of it since theme parks are my passion and I love working at one. 

I’m currently in a very low position of management, “think like shift lead” and it’s kind of bumming me out.

need some very hard job advice - help me decide,"i work at my local library in my county. i love my job and everyone in it. when i was hired for the summer, i was the assistant (i’m not going to say title) turns out the girl who i was assistant to, leaves. for the past few months i have been doing the job and in my opinion, very well and everyone else says so to. my boss now all of a sudden wants to hire a new person and for me to be their assistant although they have never having worked in a library in their life.

Can an employer take away your job for a day?,"I work in broadcast in Canada and we have an election coming up. I have covered elections many time but not with this network.

They’re having the fill in guy do it because he’s worked there longer than me. 

The thing is, it’s my team. That’s my job. Why are they doing this and can they do that? Im basically being asked to just stay out of the way for the day and let someone else direct my staff. Im dumbfounded. 

Now before you say this is a one off I’ve also done several telethons in a leadership role. This place also had someone else do my job that day. 

It would seem to me they don’t think I’m competent and take away my responsibilities when it counts. And it sure is confusing my staff end pissing me off since I have to set it all up and watch someone else execute my work and get praise.

Freelance/trial period job offer after being rejected from staff position?,"I interviewed for a job at an impressive company about a month ago. Even though they said it was a great interview, they decided not to move forward with my candidacy because I’m only a year out of college and they worried that I wouldn’t be able to handle the volume of work with my current age and experience.

Recently they called me back and offered me the job. Except this time, instead of coming on as a full time staff member (like the original job said) it is basically a trial period for them. It’s basically freelance and if they like me after 6 months I can come on as a real staff member.

I don’t know if I’m overthinking this but I’m not really comfortable with the fact that they’re not really investing in me as an employee or that they doubted my abilities to do the job before. It’s a great opportunity on paper but I’m currently in a fellowship that ends in 6 months, and after a year of being in the program I really want to work somewhere more stable and that will invest in me. I don’t want to feel like a second choice.

I’m not really desperate because I have guaranteed income for the next 6 months and I have a lot of savings. I also am actively interviewing for other roles and other job opportunities that are bubbling up so know I won’t be hurting if I turned this down. But I’m wondering if I’m being too picky for having a bad taste in my mouth.

"I got offered an exceptional opportunity, but got offered a limited duration contract. Seeking Advice","Hi, currently using my throwaway account just in case I get traced back since I've posted on here on my main account too.

So I just received my formal offer today for a dream company (well in F500) and job (fantastic projects and mobility) of mine. So a bit of a preface, I am a recent graduate who's trying to get into a niche field which is typically hard to get into as a fresh face. I've spent a lot of time especially the last 6 months or so specializing myself to get into this field. Anyways to end my preface, I'd like to think I'm quite lucky to get into this field without being in the industry, even if I have the skillsets to do it. 

&amp;#x200B;

This dream company has offered me a great salary (the max of my suggested range), a great place to begin my career in the industry, and actually lets me stay locally which is a bit of a deal for me atm. Anyways, the problem was, during my interviews, I was informed that the position will be  a fixed term x duration contract. Which at first I was iffy with, but whatever it's an okay duration and I am given the possibility of extension. I got a call just before I was given the offer, that the duration was less than what we talked about, and now that I am going through the contract,  my term has been reduced even more.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm feeling a bit disheartened at the moment, since above of everything, my main priority was to build my years of experience. I've been reduced to nearly akin to an internship. Don't get me wrong, the rest of the opportunity is actually really fantastic. Perhaps I'm just venting, and in need of someone to just tell me straight up and take the great opportunity. At the moment I actually have interviews still pending for the exact same role elsewhere. They have much better duration given what we had discussed, as well as a more clear path in career progression. Unfortunately this one requires me to move across provinces (am Canadian), and in a Bilingual city at that (which I have not been since high school).

How to prevent what seems like the inevitable(getting fired)?,"I feel like there's a cycle I go through at workplaces:

I'm not sure if I should send an email asking if/where I am in the hiring process? I was asked to apply and interviewed a month ago.,"I interned with this place several years ago while in undergrad. I was close with one the senior employees who became basically like a mentor; she actually wrote my recommendation letter for graduate school. 

In May, just before I graduated with my master's (in the field she works in/I interned in) she reached out and told me they were going to be hiring for a position in her department and she wanted me to apply. I really loved being an intern there, and this position is essentially my dream job. She is the direct supervisor for the position. 

I applied, and so did 100 other people, which is way more than she expected for an entry level position. She told me a lot of the applicants were people with established careers and my chances of getting this job were basically slim to none, but there were other jobs in the department available. She told me that she is interested in my career development and wants to support me, so she arranged for an interview with basically everybody who had open positions--the interview was with her, her boss, and three other people in the department. It was really casual because I knew everybody from when I was an intern. After the interview she said they would be in touch. I sent a thank you email a couple days later, and haven't heard anything since. Tomorrow it will be exactly four weeks since the interview and about 3 months since I applied. The job positing is still up and active. 

My problem is, at my job now (retail, not in the field I got my master's in but I love it) my store manager has told me she wants me to advance and essentially promote me. I would love to do that because I do love my job, but obviously I can't do that while still waiting to hear back about this other job. My managers are all aware I applied and everything. 

I feel like with the history I have with this place and the fact that she reached out to me to apply, I would at least get an email saying no. I kind of want to send another email telling her that I am up for a promotion at my job and need something concrete from her, either a no or a timeline if they're still working through applicants. 

I've never had a corporate job before so it feels like this is taking a super long time, but maybe it isn't for corporate world. Would another email asking for something concrete about the job be appropriate?",jobs,1.0

Laid off after my first day?,"I had just gotten a job and was excited to start. My start date was pushed a week which did not alarm me at the time. The company switched CEOs and apparently some changes were coming. I had given my 2 weeks at my other job, they did a background check, I negotiated my salary and signed offer letters, did 3 interviews, picked up the supplied computer and phone, made a home office, and other things.  Everything went very smoothly. The company is pretty big so I did not think this would be an issue.  


I showed up for my first day today (remote position but the first day was in person and the person I was supposed to meet was not notified (no-show). I waited 2 hours and started to plan out my marketing strategy.    


After waiting, and I contacted the party that should have been there and getting no reply, I told the office manager I was going to go home and work there, she agreed and called the hiring manager in front of me to notify him and he also agreed it was a good idea. HR was also told and I got the greenlight. I then had a meeting with the director of marketing(who I was meant to meet in person) online a little later and outlined our plan. Everything went great.  


I get a call from HR later telling me that they are ""no longer proceeding with the position""... They informed me that I did nothing wrong but it was a call from upper management.  The person who had hired me is no longer with them (even though I interviewed with 2 others who are still there).    


After I politely told the HR manager about the situation they would be putting me in and the general unprofessional behavior of it all, she told me she would talk to upper management to see what can be done. I am assuming nothing will be done and it was a useless platitude. They told me I would be paid for the week and I would need to arrange a drop-off for the equipment. I would also be the first pick if the position opened back up ( I would not accept it due to the nature of it all and unprofessionalism).

How The Hell Are You Supposed To Effectively Look For Jobs In Todays Market?,"So I've been looking for a remote job for the past 2-3 months. I've done some interviews but I can't help but feel like I'm missing out on positions.  Say I go on LinkedIn and type "" Information Technology"" and select the ""Remote"" option as criteria, Today alone I got 8k results for the whole country. Some jobs I may qualify for but I would never know since there are so many.  So I narrow the search down to just my state and could get 20-30 results that aren't consistent.

I feel like HR is listing the roles incorrectly, If the role is remote then select the remote option when listing the role so it reflects correctly.

Should I take the job?,"I have been working at a small software company as Sr. Marketing Operations Manager for 4 years. Since covid we have gone fully remote (which I love), I also love what I do but I have got very burned out from doing the same things everyday. I feel like I’m not learning anything new, I’m fed up with my colleagues, and the company is generally not very well run. My boss (who is great) also just announced he’s leaving the company so I started looking for new opportunities and applied to around 10 marketing operations jobs with similar roles.

I have finally got offered a job by one of the companies but it’s not the job I interviewed for, instead of Senior Marketing Operations Manager, the job they’re offering me is for a Marketing Data Analyst. The reasoning for this is because I don’t have enough management experience for the senior role. They are offering me the same salary that I already make and similar benefits. 

Should I take the job or hold out to interview at another 10+ places to then maybe not even get any of them and have to keep working my crappy job for another 6 months?

"Interview with the decision maker, now we are talking. Part 4 of ""getting a job"".","Now we are where it finally matters, the decision maker. I will only focus on the hiring manager, because although you may interview with numerous people (for my job I interviewed with 6) the end result is you need to impress the actual person you will work for, this isn't to say that the rest won't matter. The rest are easy, all you need to do is remain consistent but before we get there I need to talk about the sociology factors cause we need to be real here.

A woman on r/jobs said that I was racist because she believes I was racists toward muslims, but I will tell you what I told her. On paper there are protections in place for you, in your case you are protected because you are over 40 and because you are a woman, and because you are a muslim, that said, those protections mean shit. Why? They are easy to circumvent if you know how, in fact the easiest way they avoid this shit is not to hire you. Do not believe that your skin color, your ethnicity, sex, height, weight, clothing changes, all this shit impacts whether or not you are going to get hired or not. Now you may have a high and mighty recruiter pop on into this message of mine and call B.S. to which I will reply sarcastically ""yeah, no we don't discriminate against anyone"" \*whisper whisper\* how come then there are no black people in your company? Oh because it's in Beverly Hills? Got it...no...sorry B.S. I say this not to discourage you, but to make you realize that many of who are minorities (myself included although I easily pass as white) deal with this shit. But I felt you should know it...that said time for the manager. First again house keeping.

1. Got two copies of your resume (if you meet in person and not zoom), cover letters, references, portfolio if applicable, questions (written down that they can see or on the screen if zoom).
2. Clothes make the man/woman. Unless you suffer from dandruff issues wear black, it's slimming and it's nature automatically assumes ""professional"". Take your portfolio/resume and a folder or brief case. You want to create an air of professionalism. Even in the lowliest role your job is to look like a champ.
3. When scheduling the interview (I should have added this on the last one but it fits here too) stats show that's its best that if they were interviewing 10 people you want to be like number 7. Fuck that, try to be first. If you interview well and you know it, you are the one that stays in their mind and hearts, the rest just become a waste of time.
4. Practice in the mirror what you are going to say during the interview, have a game plan. Part of the game plan is proper hygiene, and if you have morning voice, talk talk talk and get that out the way.
5. DO NOT CHANGE YOUR ROUTINE DUE TO YOUR INTERVIEW. This means if you have breakfast but don't cause you are nervous, don't do that, you will act worse. Treat it like a normal day. 

&amp;#x200B;

So now that all that is out the way, here we go.

Understand that the manager is going to deal with multiple people, most are gonna be like you. The reality is most people can probably do what you do, and in a skilled position really there is very few things that set you apart unless you are interviewing for a lower position, understanding that then you gotta ask yourself, well then fuck...what's the goal here...simple...you want them to like you.

I said this before, at this point your resume means trash. In a skilled environment most people are gonna be able to do the job okay, so then what matters is do they like you, how you get them to like you is easy, you do that with the following:

1. When the manager asks you culture questions, use their company website to answer the question, for example: On your site it looks like you promote employee development, I myself am a huge advocate of this as I used to train employees under servant leadership which is something talked about heavily on your website, how are some ways I can add or enhance this is offered the role? 
2. Apply your skills to fix their problems. For example a company interviewed me that was kinda low on money for training, they however qualified for a fund that allows them a grant for training which I knew about, because I was able to do that, they gave me the contract.
3. Ask questions, ask questions, ask questions.
4. Be confident, competent, and make them laugh. You got to the hiring manager, most don't, flex that confidence.
5. Unlike the screener when done tell the you enjoyed your time, and ask for the job. Literally tell them that you see yourself working there, and that you see yourself as an asset and are interested in next steps, what will it take to get you there?
6. Follow up with a thank and reiterate your interest (the best way to do this is more poignant questions.

4. A few back up questions in case they answer them during the screen

Alright ladies and gents I am going to tell you something now that you are going to hate but here is the truth. Your resume at this point means absolutely nothing. Most people will hire you because they like you, your experience be damned. Why? Simple. Even me as good as I am at my role I can tell you that there are people out there that are better than me, but I have job over them right? There are a myriad of reasons for this and I will cover them. Before I get to that section I will preface this by saying that there are sociological reasons too for why people don't get jobs, I will share those with you but they will piss you off. You've been warned. Anyhow first for the screener.

So in my experience unless you are unskilled the screener is going to have no idea what the fuck you do. They will be reading from a list of things that the manager wants and you will need to answer in the affirmative. Believe or not you want a screener like this. Why? Cause your job is to impress them, how do you impress them? Through knowledge and humility, anyhow let's go through the steps.

1. Research the company and generate questions from here. Make sure you understand what it is they do.
2. Read the job posting in detail, high light any sections you want to emphasize during the screening. If it says ""highly sought after or must haves"" and you have those make as much attention as you can during the interview about them. 
3. First thing is first, when they first call take a minute or two to ask them how they are, thank them for today, and get to know them. They will report your disposition just as much as your resume. Kindness here goes further than anything else. 
4. Answer each question with zeal and examples: Did you ever drink a forklift? Why yes, I am actually licensed in using a forklift and I would say 80% of my day was based on putting away material, based on feedback from my team and my manager I was the most efficient and safest driver. 
5. Have questions for them, most times if it is skilled they can't answer them and that's okay, in those cases say ""that's okay thank you, during the next round of interviews i'll go ahead and ask the manager"". This is a sales tactic used in making yourself and them feel like you have the job.
6. Ask about next steps and be enthusiastic. I am looking forward to next steps and meeting so and so.
7. Make sure that you get their name and phone number and email before the convo ends, sometimes stuff ends up in spam and you forget about it, don't risk it.
8. Most times before the convo ends the recruiter will say if you have any further questions etc. Always ask questions, even just one...
9. When they tell you if you have further questions email. Please do, in fact use this as an opportunity to send a thank you email.
10. Add those questions, answers, emails, all info to the ""interviewer"" folder I told you about. 

Now the interview is over and you may be curious (am I moving on) well here are a few taletales

1. Remember the next steps question? Were they ecstatic or avoiding? Did they tell you there will be/won't be?
2. How was the tone of the convo? Did you make them laugh? Did you keep it uplifting and positive?
3. Did you ask questions? 

Now earlier I mentioned that there are sociological reasons why you make not get past the screener and here's what I mean which I will go in more detail in the next section. That said, statically for most roles unless they are deemed or considered ""gender specific"" think nurses=female, there is specific type of person who is hired. Historically it's a white male the ages of 25 and older who is at least 6 feet tall. Weird and shitty right? Well keep that in mind for when I go to the next section cause this is where it will matter.",jobs,1.0

What jobs should you apply to? Part two in the series of how to get a job. The first one was resume/cover letter.,"You now have a resume and several cover letters, but where do you actually apply? How do you maximize your time? Okay, hang on to your seats ladies and gents, this one is the going to be heavy cause this one is unfortunately in my opinion the shittiest part, the actual looking. Now that said...

There are job postings everywhere; craigslist, facebook, indeed, monster, linkedin, and third party headhunters to name a few. Now depending on your skill level some of these are going to be more useful to you than others, so let's start with skill level:

1. unskilled labor: Please don't take offense to the term, but this is a thing. This refers to a job that pretty much anyone can do, bussers, janitors, factory (think amazon). The bulk of these jobs you will be able to find on facebook/craigslist and on indeed. This isn't to say they aren't on linkedin or monster (actually monster has a good bunch of these too), but the others are synonymous especially third party headhunters like appleone (they suck ass imo). 
2. entry level: this is a job that requires you to add more cheese to your nachos. this is anything from customer service to data entry. Similar to unskilled most of these jobs you will find in the same places.
3. skilled/low/mid management: These 3 don't necessary mean you are a manager, sup, or leadership. It just means you are either specialized because you are a manager, specialized because of a niche/education, or a combination of the three. The best jobs for these will be found on linkedin, indeed, and through networking opportunities. 
4. exec/skilled: Most if not all are done through headhunting and or linkedin. (I fall in this range). 

Now before I move on the list above is not all encompassing but all of you will fall somewhere in that mix, and knowing that will help you narrow down where to apply, now before you apply a few house keeping rules.

1. Email address: [Ihaveafatdick@yahoo.com](mailto:Ihaveafatdick@yahoo.com) is not going to help you get a job, i'm sorry. If you have an email like this, please get a new one.
2. Did you update your resume and your cover letters? All the info current? up to date? 
3. Do you have your voicemail set up? Nowadays they do text you but it's best to have a voicemail set up.
4. Got clothes? Still fit in that suit? 
5. Portfolio up to date (if applicable)
6. certifications up to date (if applicable)

Okay now it's time to apply. First regardless if you use google, yahoo, aol, msn, please for the sake of all that is holy create folders for each job that you apply to. This folder is going to have the company name, the job, contact information if available, and how far you got in the interview process if you even got an interview, this will be important for networking later. So now I am going to walk you through what I do to give you an example. 

1. Go on indeed/linkedin and look at the jobs.
2. On indeed, apply and when given the option create an account and set it up so that recruiters can reach out to you. 
3. On indeed when you apply to jobs, the next day or in a few days it sometimes gives you the option to send a messenger to the hiring manager, do so. 
4. After you applied take that resume, cover letter, application (if possible) and basically any information and store it in a folder. Why? If you get an interview you don't want to be lost in the cloud as to who this company. More importantly if they don't hire you today, they may hire you later, by you keeping a record of all the jobs you applied to and the people you spoke to you set yourself up for future roles.

The above I actually prefer doing on linkedin because linkedin sometimes let's you apply easily and even better get directly a hold of a recruiter. So for linkedin same process as above except and this is key:

1. if the recruiter is attached to the job role, email them, contact them and say something to the effect of: Hi, my name is 13inchmushroommaker and I just applied to role xyz, do you have a few minutes to discuss this role with me so that we may set up an interview? Don't be afraid to take the initiative, the worse they can say is no.
2. Many recruiters i've spoken to have told me that no one does the above (except for managers and execs) so clearly they get it.

So now you are probably thinking, okay great mush, but like what jobs do I apply to. Okay let's cover that, let's assume you are applying for customer service for the sake of this doc. Go to any site listed above (jobs can be found on any of those sites I just mentioned what types of jobs I find per my experience) and now 9 out of 10 times you are going to see that you probably don't meet all the criteria. So? Most of us don't, even me. But that shouldn't stop you from applying. In fact for those of you still in college here's a tip. Did you know that scholarship money has to be given away every year? If this is a scholarship that no one applies to, but you do even if you don't meet the criteria they will give it to you, how do I know? I knew a guy who got a full ride on a woman's scholarship for a S.T.E.M. as most women didn't apply cause they thought it was beyond them...anyhow that said. 

1. Apply to all jobs that match what you are looking for even if you don't meet the criteria completely.
2. Do not apply for the same role multiple times or through a 3rd party headhunter, this will usually disqualify you.
3. If you see customer service that has specific words like ""POS"" ""Hot Schedules"" or buzz words, and you have experience in that, add that to your resume, specifically as to how it applies to that role.

Lastly remember you are a professional job seeker, and that is also a job. Like any job it's gonna get frustrating, you are gonna complain about your boss, the pay sucks etc. But it needs to be done. So don't lose your head, and if any of the above is confusing or you need more help, please reach out. That's it for this segment, next is so you got the interview/screening, now what?",jobs,1.0

From production to quality assurance?,"Looking for some insight.  I am currently working as a contract production operator in a Circuit card assembly facility.  I have the option to possibly move to Quality assurance for the same facility. This would be moving departments. The current hiring manager for my department isn't wanting to convert me into a regular employee for another year. If i moved to quality I've been told i would become a regular employee sooner. One of our QA's has also agreed to recommend me for the position and is willing to train me 

I love my current position and I'm considered a top contractor but they have been giving me the runaround about being converted to a regular employee. After a year i could potentially move back to production if i wasn't happy but I'd have to stay a year. This is a large company that is okay with internal movement once hired on 

The bad of being a contractor is the instability. Expensive health insurance and you don't qualify for raises or bonuses 

If stayed in production i would want to become a technician down the road but I'm unsure what the promotion track is for quality?

IMHO management has gotten worse and a lot of the various departments are toxic and very detrimental to people’s mental health. The rules are ridiculous. You cant leave your desk until 4:58. You can’t leave the parking lot until 5. Keep your cell phone in your desk drawer (when your boss is constantly on hers). Things like that.  I’m afraid because of my age people will not hire me.

Is this position a scam?,"Hello!

Yesterday I applied to a Project Manager position on LinkedIn. I got a mostly generic response today from a real person with plenty of recommendations and connections, asking me to send my resume to an outlook email address. The email address was a little strange but not overly concerning. He told me to send my resume to the hiring manager to that email but didn’t give me any name. 

I sent my resume to the email address and got a response pretty fast, within a few hours. Again, on a Sunday, right before Labor Day.

I got the following email:

“Hello “OP”, I’ve seen your credentials and I must say it’s quite impressive and you seem like a quality candidate for this position therefore I sincerely recommend that you fill out the government IRS form sent to you just now, attach a copy of your driver’s license or state Id front and back and kindly drop a cellphone number where I can reach you. 
 
                 We are currently doing all interview remotely and We’ll definitely get back to you if you are qualified for this position with whichever docs you provide and in addition applicant must be vaccinated before showing up for final interview.
 
Please list 2-3 dates and time ranges that you could come by to our office after your interview ?
 
 
Thank you,”

As you can see the email is very vague, doesn’t specify what the position actually is, uses capitalized letters in the middle of sentences, extra space before a question mark, is poorly constructed in general and the sender did not provide a name!

Furthermore, the second paragraph doesn’t make much sense. The position was also listed as remote, yet they want me to do an in-person interview? There’s a lot of inconsistencies here.

They are obviously asking for a lot of personal information here that I am not comfortable giving out.

The W-4 form they sent me does seem 100% legitimate though.

I have not had a single interview with these people. It is really strange what they are requesting.

I told them that I do not feel comfortable giving out my personal information, stated my concerns with the email and everything and told them that I’m happy to interview for the position if they send me a zoom link to my email address and I can confirm the legitimacy of the job.

And once we come to an agreement on everything I’ll be happy to proceed with my application.

Potential red flags?
1. Response on a Sunday before Labor Day.
2. Strange email address I had to send my resume to.
3. Poorly written and vague email.
4. Asking for a lot of personal information before even conducting an interview.
5. Sender did not provide a name.

The only reason I got hired at this job..is because my brother is friends with one of the really big managers. So, this whole situation just keeps escalating. I’ve made like 1,000 posts on it, but I’ve deleted them all. Anyways here’s a little catch-up. I started working at this grocery store as a cashier. I was on register twice and they haven’t put me on it in over two months. I asked why and they said they didn’t know. Well, yesterday one of the managers basically told me that I sucked as a cashier and I would need extra training. Today I was talking about it with my family…and brother was like “what is the managers name” and I told him his name AND THEN HE SAID THAT HE WOULD TELL HIS FRIEND ABOUT HIM. I literally feel sick to my stomach, because I don’t want anyone to get in trouble. This is why I never tell my family anything..they always have to butt in. What am I supposed to do.

Should I tell my manager about my new job offer?,"So I have been in this role for about 6-7 months. I don't really enjoy it, its a lot of work, pay is meh and I don't really like the department.

I have just accepted an offer for a new position elsewhere. It suits me so much more as there are at least 3 people working at one time. Which means less stress and also working on the cash register. 

I am very good friends with my manager. She is basically on the same level as me (IE working hours, even more exploited - and bullied by upper management). I stressed her out by telling her I'm going to college. I'm so afraid to let her down because I really do care for her. She has come to me in desperation for money for food and electricity.

Work for myself or work at my job until the dust settles?,"Hello all,


I recently went through a scandal at work.
Long story short- my coworkers have been giving my boss false information about me. As a result of this I got a very long email listing about 20 things that I have been doing wrong and only 3 of which were actually true in some regard. Fortunately I had a few screen shots and there are records to back me up so it is not simply he say she say. I couldn’t imagine where I would be without these as it would have been me vs everyone else. As a result of the situation I realized the people who I see 40 hours a week and thought were my friends gossip about me behind my back and assume things that are completely untrue. The reason why they go to my boss with this is because my boss facilitates this environment (wish I picked up on it sooner). She is never on sight so she gets her information through probing everyone for questions, and I’ve heard her say negative things about other coworkers to me as well. Long story short- there are several red flags with this establishment. The only upswing is the pay is good which leads me to my dilemma.


My goal has always been independent practice to be my own boss. After the situation I discovered I qualify to make that dream to become a reality. It also wouldn’t (hopefully) take incredibly long (1 month at best). My question is- should I stick out a 2 week period at work? Or just terminate my leave immediately and be a starving artist for a bit? I have the funds to survive for a bit and be comfortable- I have loans and savings and scholarships. My fear is just I won’t be able to upkeep my lifestyle particularly saving 30% of what I make every month. I want to suck it up but I can’t bare the sight of going to work with the people who put me here. Especially when thinking we were all friends. Do I get over it or take a chance?


TLDR; my coworkers set me up with faulty accusations. I don’t see myself staying at my job. My ultimate goal has been to be independent which I could do in about a month. But I am unsure if I should stay 2 weeks or quit effective immediately as it’s hard to think about seeing my coworkers. I also have money I could survive off of for the time being but I’m nervous about not being able to save/have funds.",jobs,1.0

I figured they might also just be caught up with Labor Day and it’s also a job at a Community College so maybe they’re busy with classes starting soon.

But do any of you know how long this process normally takes? It feels pretty slow, and Im starting to get a bit worried, but Im trying not to worry too much because it just feels unlucky they’ll pull the offer because I’ve been very professional and I think my counter offer was reasonable.

Anyone have any advice from personal experience?",jobs,1.0

SAHM looking to return after 11 years… where to start?,"I’ll keep this short and sweet. I’m prior military paralegal, got out after 6 years to be a stay at home mom.

Earned a bachelors (criminal justice) and a masters degree (forensic psychology) but have no experience in the fields other than what I did when I was active duty. My husband is still AD so we’ll probably move again twice before he retires in a few years. 

I have a LinkedIn account, but it’s not up to date or strong, so I need to update that, but honestly i hate the platform.

Offered the job I initially wanted but feel obligated to stay with current job,"**A summary introduction:**
I am currently in banking, and have been since February of 2019. I started off enjoying it, and grew to hate it. I had a couple opportunities to leave, but in the end, felt like I had more benefits and stability with the bank so I stayed. The biggest reason I hate it, is the sales expectations even as a teller. I was driving 30 minutes one way each day to the branch I was at.

**Current**
Picking up where I left off, I interviewed in May of this year for a promotion with the bank and also a job with my county's Register of Deeds. Both are in my current county, so the drive was cut from 30 minutes down to 10 minutes from my house. Long story short, the Register of Deeds chose a girl who had recently lost her job and I got the promotion with the bank to be teller supervisor. 

**Most Recently**
I've been in the role of teller supervisor for almost two months. I still dislike the bank, but the drive is better and the people I work with are better aside from one. I was given an increase of around $8-9k more a year when I accepted the position. Friday, the Register of Deeds contacted me to let me know he had another opening and wanted to know if I was still interested. I went after work and spoke to him face to face. I would be losing the increase I just got to work with him, the drive would be the same amount of time, but my insurances would be free to me so I'd essentially have around $200-250 more per month than I was making pre-promotion with the bank. 


**The Issue**
Being that I've only been with this location for two months, I feel guilty for leaving. The worker I mentioned previously is taking a promotion with another branch towards the end of the month that is the same as my current role. With my leaving, it would delay her from leaving, and essentially put the branch in a bind staffing-wise. I would like to believe in working a two week notice that I would maintain the ability to use them as a job reference in the future, but I'm not sure if they would give me a good reference or not for leaving quickly.

I'm hoping someone can talk to me about the best course of action in this situation. Am I wise to leave even though I'm making a decent amount more money but hate it? If so, how can I leave in the best way possible or is there even a best way? 
Thank you.



TLDR: Currently in banking, hate the sales expectations,  recently took a promotion 2 months ago, received a job offer for less money but unsure if its wise leave. If it is wise to leave, how can I leave?",jobs,1.0

However, because of the nature of the job; very demanding, starting early and finishing late, they don’t bring food but instead they have lunch out every day.

On the other hand I’m someone who’s used to bringing homemade food and I don’t like having outside food too often, health and cost wise.

How to write a cover letter and resume,"I heard all of you, so now I am going to be attempt to be a part of the solution and not the problem, so without further ado...here's how to do both, first lets' start with a cover letter.

What's a cover letter: A quick nitty gritty view of you that is a condensed version of your resume plus your personality kicked in, so when a few things before I show you how to write one:

1. Have multiple cover letters: If you are applying for a manager role make the cover letter specific to being a manager with the traits and competencies attached to it. A line worker? Customer service? Whatever, you want multiples. Not only will this make it faster for you to apply for roles, but as you build your networking base as you sent out set cover letters you can add them to your job seeker folder on your computer or wherever you store it.
2. Give it color: I don't literally mean color, I mean don't be afraid to let the interviewer see who you are...
3. Key words key words key words: You are a master at SAS (software as a service) add it, you know python, HTML, java script, add it, some companies do use screening tools that will look out for this.
4. Highlight any awards, accomplishments achievements: Even I sold the most subscriptions at gamestop carries weight over a guy who just wrote (worked at gamestop). 

So how do you format? Okay so my cover letter looks something like:

If you are looking for the best instructional designer in your company for x role, then I 13inchmushroommaker am the guy for you. I have over 15 years in training and development, coupled with my masters in organizational leadership i've had the privilege of working for some of the largest organizations on earth that have gained me such skills as xyz that I have applied in xyz ways. To recap if an ID who is both a great mix of experience and education that has out of the box solutions is what you need then I 13inchmushroomaker is the person you are looking for. 

Okay now your resume, and how to format:

1. Career objective: State in 3-5 sentences what your goal is, what you are, what you intend to do, and don't be afraid of putting in where you'd like to be in a few years.
2. Job experience: What most people don't put here is the software/hardware they used, they only stated what they did. They only don't state what awards, achievements, praises they've won. Did you improve the company at all? Add that.
3. Education: This goes at the bottom, but the same as above, any achievements? awards? clubs? extra curriculars? You can even attach hobbies here if they have some relevance. You gonna be a security guard? A bjj black belt looks good on there.
4. Skills: Okay i've notice people just throw random things out there. Don't do that. Gather like terms, you do software? Add all the software under software, hardware under hardware etc. Make it easier for them to scan through.
5. References: Don't add them, put them available by request. 
6. One page resumes: Fuck that, that is old school. If someone tells you that your resume needs to be one page they can suck it. 

That is not a comprehensive list but it's what has worked for me even to this day, if you have questions or want to call it ""shit"" advice like someone else did, please don't hesitate to do so.",jobs,1.0

"Left 6-year job on poor terms, need advice on references","Hey hey everyone. This is a very touchy subject but anyone have any advice for me? I feel comfortable sharing it here. Read very bottom for quick summary if you prefer not to read the ramble.

My old job had a bed bug issue and the bugs were hiding in the cloth cubicles. It was a really distressing event and I was swelling up like a balloon once I was bit. Hired an exterminator at home because I thought it was coming from the house, threw away a good chunk of my room and went a little - ok, a lot - mentally crazy for a while. Turns out it *wasn't* our house. A coworker eventually found a nest inside a few cloth cubicles once a hole started to form on the cloth. There was no one in our building from 8pm-5am, so me coming in to sit at my desk at 5:30am was pretty much their breakfast. Maintenance already knew about this issue, saying it was ""dust mites"" but placed the blame on me because they weren't finding anything on the sticky traps. Maintenance yelled at me in front of everyone ""WHERE ARE THE BUGS KELLY? WHERE???"" 

Once they found the nest, they apologized but it was never the same after that. HR didn't like me due to the fact that I had stuck up for myself in a meeting over it and believe me- I was vocal. I mean I practically went nuts after this, staying up all night waiting for bugs that weren't even in my room. I lost a lot of weight after, I looked very sick, I couldn't take care of myself properly, I was in and out of a ""bed bug bed bug bed bug"" thought process and in general people quit talking to me because I was a mess and was no longer my bubbly, happy, smiling self. I totally understand.

 However, certain coworkers continued to treat me like dirt, certain coworkers would make it clear through words ""I ain't sitting next to you"", would laugh when walking by my desk, and HR made it clear that I was a drama queen. I felt so unsupported, so disturbed, and very sad. I was GREAT at my old job, enjoyed it, was there for 6 years, and performed so well but because of how I left, I'm afraid I'll have some trouble in a few months. 

I left quickly and on poor terms. I regret it but there is nothing I can do to change the past. My resignation letter wasn't the nicest after I found out that my coworkers were using my situation to tell people I was on drugs. I have never been on drugs and that really hurt me. I had an upcoming surgery a few months after the bed bug ordeal and even with valid proof of needing the surgery, HR quizzed me regarding any drug abuse. I was so hurt that I quit on the spot, mentioning how terrible their treatment was of me while and after dealing with *their* bed bug issue in *their* building. I wasn't the only person getting bit, but it seems that no matter how many bugs they found in the cloth cubicles, it was still my fault. Even though I resigned, I won a lengthy unemployment battle and the investigation concluded that I was being harassed and it was an irreversible difference of personality between employers/myself.

Any advice? I'm absolutely going to include them on my resume because it was a great job and I learned so much.. I have a few friends from there still, but I'm nervous they are going to go directly to HR but HR was my last straw once they decided to quiz me on drugs. I busted my ass for this company in ways that are still succeeding today - what can I do?

**TLDR;** undeniable bed bug issue at work, coworkers treated me like shit after, HR treated me like shit after, due to my poor mental health from this I quit on poor terms. need help when it comes to references.

I said “F___ YOU” to a customer yesterday at work. Do you think what I said is justified?,"This is all ironic timing if you read my last “jobs” post where I quit but decided to stay after being begged to but here we go… 

So I had a 40yr married couple who from the beginning were rude, and acting very entitled and bossy towards me. I found myself biting my tongue a lot through the whole exchange with them which ended up being a couple hours long. 
The fact is I’m not a push over, and I refuse to get taken advantage of anymore in my personal or professional life; so I don’t blend well with people who treat me like I’m here to take their order and be their slave. I stood my ground when the wife tried to talk over me, continuing to get my point across and spoke with authority yet still respectful, unlike themselves. 
I did my best to please them in a way that was not degrading (like having them b*tch me around). And I managed to get very far with them this way. Things were going good until I showed them the quote of their potential purchase. They were very mad even though everything they saw on the sheet was previewed in the beginning in order to try and avoid this attitude/prob… 
The cusotmer would only tell me what they wouldn’t pay so I asked repeated what would they pay to strangely get no answer just more complaints. I tried to relate to the cusotmer to point out that true to what they told me earlier, the last time they had made a purchase  of this kind was 13 yrs ago. I ask them if that was true? I was ready to explain how things have changed so drastically since then but her pitiful husband decided to lose his shit. 

He slammed his hand on my table stood up leaned over the table in my face pointing his finger barely inch away from my nose and said “don’t you ever fking disrespectful my wife like that again” then he said F_ck this (possibly f_ck you) to which I then stood up and said, “NO F__CK YOU.” 

At that point they had crossed the line. I can deal with rude customers but when you stand up invading my personal space point your finger at me and cuss at me after slamming your hand on my desk, that draws every line for me.

Then they decided to ask me things “show me where is my this and that is where is your manager”
 and I told them, figure it out yourself! I said, “you disrespected me therefore you don’t get help from me anymore. Go away.”

The clowns said it again who’s your boss etc pointing there finger and I said go figure it out yourself bye we’re done here. you’re gonna have to ask someone else because you no longer get help from me.” Then they storm off go my manager saying I said this and that. 

Nor I had never spoken to a customer like that and I have certainly had my more than fair  share of difficult and rude customers but never had I had someone invading my personal space like that and turn so irate and so unexpectedly you would’ve thought I had said some thing insane but I was just talking like a normal human being trying to help them understand something I do every single day and that I’m trained to do. Quite frankly he’s lucky that’s all I did because I wanted to snatch that finger and bend it backwards till it snapped off. And to do that to a young 20-year-old female is even more disgusting. 

Tl;Dr: if a customer slams their hand on your desk stands up points their finger barely an inch away from your face and cusses at you multiple times, do you think it’s a justified response to say “F_CK you” back and not get reprimanded or fired by your managers?",jobs,1.0

Job ideas and suggestions appreciated,"Hello! I’m a second year 9th and 10th grade science teacher at an inner city school. 

In college I was planning to go to dental school and studied biochemistry. I even got interviews everywhere I applied, but I ended up getting very sick and ultimately had to give up that choice. 

Now I’m working as a teacher and it’s just not what I envisioned. The students are mean, administration is throwing way more jobs our way than should be allowed, classroom management is a nightmare, contacting 70 parents every week is dreadful, I have some serious second hand trauma going on, and I’m getting sick all the time from being around so many students. I just can’t do it anymore and I really don’t want to either. This will be my last year. 

The issue is idk what I want to do. To be honest, I don’t even find biochemistry all that fascinating. I only did it and then dentistry because my parents told me they wouldn’t help pay for college unless I did a STEM subject. Little did I know the sciences were over saturated and realistically a lot of science related jobs require PhDs, medical/dental/vet school, or teacher. 

Where I live the pay for teachers isn’t really all that bad. It’s $60,000 a year and given I haven’t been out of college this long it’s hard to find out what I should do because I don’t just want yo job hop constantly. 

I’ve considered going back to school. At first I thought about nursing, but in many ways they have a lot of similar issues and again, I get sick very easily. I also don’t think I’d be able to withstand shift work or the amount of empathy expected of that sort of job. 

I’ve considered learning to code and then getting my masters in computer science but I worry I won’t want to work 60 hours a week like many of my friends do to stay up to date on the newest technologies and advancements. 

I’d really love to find something I can be with my dogs doing. It doesn’t matter if I work from home, bring them with me, or actively involve them in what I do everyday. I just find my levels of happiness are way higher with them.

Part of the reason is due to the restrictive contracts that employers enforce. E.g not allow bussiness. I really want to build up a portfolio of clients and so am looking to avoid using recruiters who again use restrictive contracts. E.g. No soliciting the client.

Any advice for a current college student who is seeking employment in a degree related field?,"I am a college student enrolled in a bachelors transfer degree at a community college in Florida. Currently, I am in the process of completing my last semester before I am required to transfer to a university. I am major is English with a minor in Poli science and upon the completion of my bachelors I plan to further my education and career by attending law school. Although I attend a community college, I have worked extremely hard to obtain good grades, have a few of my essays published, and won a few writing contests. Last semester I was offered an editor position for my colleges magazine which shockingly provided me with a scholarship.   
 

The positive results I received sparked a newfound confidence in me, inspired me to dive full force into my goals and move by myself, from Florida to New York. While proud of my decision, I have found myself faced with the issue of finding employment.  

I currently work remotely, as a customer service supervisor. However, the company is based in Florida and unfortunately will require us to transition back into the office in 4 months. I have applied for a multitude of corresponding careers, from legal assistant to editor. All entry level, but I have had no luck yet. The majority require work 1–3 years' work experience. I also believe community college on a resume is not very appealing.  

I would really love to work in a field that correlates with my career goals so I can utilize my skills while also learning more. I do not know what to include or exclude on my resume and I just feel as if I have hit a roadblock. I am grateful for any available advice, tips, or guidance you can give me. ",jobs,1.0

I feel incompetent. Should I consider another field?," I just started working as a developer and I constantly feel like I'm not up to the task. Besides a two month internship I have never worked before and I'm now panicking because they expect things from me I can't deliver. I can ask my colleagues for help but they don't specialize in this task, which is why they hired me. I am also told it is unusual for the employer to ask for so much from me from the start.

To make things worse, I'm not even sure this is something I want to be doing but rather something I pursued mostly to appease my parents. It can be fun at times but mostly just very stressful and I want to quit after a week of officially working (I had 2 weeks of training). I don't know what I want to do, because the pay is fair but I'd rather just work in a shop where I don't have deadlines looming over my head even when I'm not supposed to be working.

Bottom line is, should I quit? Maybe I could find a similar job for a more lenient company but at the same time maybe this line of work is not for me. I've never been so stressed in my life and part of it is my panicky personality but regardless I can't help but feel stressed.  Otherwise all of my coworkers are extremely kind and the atmosphere is relaxed.

I just don't find any one field particularly interesting, as a kid I wanted to be an artist/musician but my parents didn't let me pursue that path, now I would also like to teach English which I have a certificate for but doesn't seem enough for most employers. It seems whatever I focus on at  the moment, the interest dissipates in a few weeks. I don't want to quit because I'm afraid I'll never feel competent in any field so I better stay put but at the same time the feeling of incompetence is stressing me out so much I can't sleep nor eat.

"Job hunt depression, and barriers","Im getting really depressed on the post-grad job hunt. I have two majors from my school, both in STEM, but little to no experience outside of academia (thanks, COVID, for hitting right as my junior year started). I definitely shot myself in the foot not pushing more during undergrad for out of school experience, but how do I recover from that? Volunteer work is shut down due to COVID still (my state is really bad right now) and my work isn’t really a job you can do remotely since I’m trying to get wet lab experience. I’m trying to learn python so I can add more to my skill set, but it’s not easy for me. Can’t relocate for personal reasons, and my biggest barrier is that I’m trans. 


I’m committed to entering my career 100% out, I’ve started medical transitioning but cannot legally (name change, etc) transition since I’m not out to most of my family and still rely on them for help. I can barely network, let alone use social media for fear of my family finding out. They’re trying their best to help me but all of their contacts probably think I’m not a good candidate since I don’t want to navigate that trans/closeted minefield and don’t usually follow up. If I wasn’t trans I would probably have a job right now, but as it is I’m basically stuck sending out blind applications and getting no calls back. My resume sucks, my networking sucks, and it just feels hopeless. I want to improve my experience but it just feels like it’s impossible right now. 


And endless cycle: can’t get a job without networking, can’t (safely) network unless I’m 100% out, can’t be 100% out until I’m financially free from my family, can’t be financially free until I’ve started my career and am fully supporting myself.

Slim pickings seeking part-time work as a college student,"Apologies if this question is blindingly obvious, but I'm a bit stuck. I'm a college student looking for a part-time job while I finish up my last year. I've held two retail jobs in the past, and I heard about each of those opportunities because I had friends who worked there, let me know that they were hiring, and encouraged me to apply. I quit my last job to work a really valuable summer internship on the other side of the country and I traveled a bit afterwards. Now I'm back home and 'properly' searching for a job for the first time. I was initially just going to coast by on my savings for the last year (I still live at home and my only expenses are dining/gas/entertainment) but I realized it'd get boring and I may as well continue adding to my nest egg while I have the privilege of not worrying about rent and bills.

I've been browsing Craigslist and Indeed (uploaded my resume here too) but I'm finding it extremely difficult to find anything suitable. I am being slightly ""picky"" in that I won't take just /any/ job, but supposedly places are starving for entry-level workers. Minimum wage in my city is $14, and with two years' prior retail/sales experience I'd like to think I can land something *at least* starting at $15 or higher. I'm looking for between 12-24 hours per week (30+ is just not realistic with my course load) and I have full availability beyond the two days I'm in class. I have nothing against going back to retail and I'm happy to do general labor or warehouse work. At the same time, I'm not looking to be run ragged and pee in bottles and forced to skip lunches by neurotic managers.

Do you guys have any guidance on how best to continue searching? Any recommendations for jobs you enjoyed while in college? Lastly: can you seriously not sort jobs by hourly rate on Indeed?

Job fairs are the way to go,"So I am getting out of the military soon and want to make sure I have a job lined up for when I am out. At this point I am mostly convinced that the online sites like indeed are a waste of time. Over the last 2 months I applied to almost 60 different positions ranging from entry level positions to management within the field I am experienced in. To date, I only had 2 interviews, 1 random phone call and an email that didnt even respond back when they asked my availability for an interview.

I was getting really nervous because I was reaching the  point where if I didnt get something soon, we would be in a tricky situation. I ended up researching virtual job fairs and found a couple happening over the past couple weeks. I signed up, waited for the day while still posting applications daily.

Once the day for my first virtual job fair happened I made sure I was wearing a nice shirt and tie and logged in. Within a few minutes I was in text chat with recruiters from a few different companie and couple hours later I had completed 3 web cam interviews.

Sure enough, just three days ago I got a call back from the very first company that reached out to me during the virtual job fair. I did another web cam interview, they said I would hear back from them in a couple weeks but I got a call back 30 MINUTES LATER with a job offer!!!! Then just the next day I got another request from one of the other companies for an interview.

"Went job searching today, made me realize how pointless college is.","Here's what I'm struggling to understand. You go to college, you get a bachelor's, a master's whatever, great you've seemingly made it. Now unless you're some sort of engineer it seems that for entry level positions you're only going to make a buck or two more than a barista at starbucks who never went to college or has degree's and cert's.

Lately i've been feeling like in this life, a lot of doors can open, but those doors are all linked on the same floor. Meaning that, the progression is pointless because it lacks ascension, at least a distinguishable ascension that's reflected by pay rates.

I want to work in HR, as I'm looking for jobs just to get some experience as an HR assistant, I see that most of the entry level jobs only pay 13-17/hr and all require a bachelor's degree. That's the type of shit i'm going to be dealing with when I get my degree? Never wanted to dropout before so much, this is a joke.

Is it worth staying at a horrible job for the experience?,"I started a new job in my field just over 6 months ago. There were some initial red flags in the interview, i.e. the person I am now reporting directing to badmouthing and acting condescending towards other employees. I told myself based on this interview alone (which also included 2 other rounds and an assessment task) that I would not take the job, yet here I am.

This job has taken a severe toll on my mental health. I am undermined, made to feel like an absolute idiot (and am also told so) to the point where I am too afraid to even do anything on my own accord. I am quite literally a shell of myself. This place is notorious for high turnover and I have it on good faith that people who previously reported to this person have left as a direct result of him. I am still junior in my field, and in fact, I was told by another employee that they give me '6 months' before I crumble under supervision from this person. Looks like they were right. I have actually sought professional help from a therapist, largely due to this job.

There is no structure, guidance, and the whole department is an unorganised mess with priorities that shift on a minute basis. 

Here is my issue:

  
I was made redundant from my last position in this field right before COVID which only lasted for a year, and as such spent last year working in an unrelated field which I enjoyed and performed superbly at.

I have been interviewing since month 4 and unfortunately did not receive an offer for a job I really wanted after 3 interviews. I have more interviews coming up, but my question boils down to:

Should I grit my teeth. show some resilience and stick this out for at least a year to look more employable to employers/recruiters? Should I just fucking quit and look for something else? I'm not sure how much I can take. I have a large amount of savings and am lucky enough to be still living at home so money is not an issue, however I'd prefer to have something else lined up before jumping ship.",jobs,1.0

"Should I negotiate my salary after accepting verbal offer, after being offered a higher salary from another company?","I got a verbal offer from company A, which I accepted. So far no written contract has been sent to me yet. However, the next day I received a written offer from company B with a much higher salary. There are pros and cons of each company so I haven't decided if I actually want to go to company B atm, one of the reasons being company A is a much larger company with apparently better culture. At this point, should I negotiate my salary with company A hoping to get a slight increase? Since it's not advisable to actually tell them ""I received another offer with much higher salary"", I'll probably go along the lines of ""after accepting the verbal, tentative offer, I did some more research into the market and found that the salary for my experience and skillset should be a bit higher"". I want to tread carefully here since if company A closes the salary gap, even if it's still lower than company B, I'll probably go with company A.

Trouble deciding between 2 offers,"Hi Reddit,

So I’ve never been in this position before in my life. Im deciding between 2 offers with great comp/benefits, but there’s clear pros and cons to each.

Offer 1: very early stage start up, less than 100 employees. I’d be the only person owning the entire function when I’m used to working on a team. It’s definitely a great way for me to move up, but it also feels like 2 jobs for 1 salary, being the only person owning this particular function. High visibility role. Base is lower, but they have a bonus (company 2 doesn’t), and 401k match. Equity is lower than company 2 as well. But overall, package is similar with slightly better benefits considering the 401k match. Company has less brand recognition and let’s say my role is tied to sales so that could be difficult for me. Team i spoke with is wonderful and sounds genuine. I just worry about all the work I’d have to do for a similarly salary to job no.2. One thing I’m also worried about is that let’s say this company is headquartered in an area with a lot of political conflict. Not sure if it aligns with my ethics. 

Offer 2:  more developed startup, better brand recognition overall. Base is higher and equity is higher, but no 401k match. They had layoffs due to the pandemic but hired some of their team back and are hiring full force right now. I would be on a larger team so would have a lot more support. I liked the entire team but heard from a back channel reference that the VP of the team can be toxic. I spoke with several members of the team about this and they let me know they didn’t feel this way about him and if anything, he defends his own department a lot which could rub other departments the wrong way.  Also, on a larger team, I feel like it will be harder to move up within a role, so that’s the other downside here. Although, they have said they will pair me with a mentor to help push me towards the management track which appeals to me. 

So overall, company no. 1 has a slightly higher package in terms of TC, for nearly double the work but a good chance of upward mobility. I value W/L balance so this is the main concern for me. 
Company no. 2 has a very strong package as well, I’d be in a larger team, but some questions around how quickly I’d be able to move up. They have touted they’ll put me on the track to management but not sure how solid that is. W/L balance would definitely be stronger here. 

Kind of torn - there’s clear upsides and downsides of each. Wondering if anyone has been in a similar situation and would be willing to provide insight/advice :)",jobs,1.0

Does leaving your first job in 6 months look bad?,"So I’m at my 4th month in my current job and though my manager, and the other people in my company are nice I just don’t feel like this is the best place for me.

1) A no-name, 5 people company that I don’t see growing anytime soon.
2) I am the only female and by far the youngest person in an office of 40 people. (most are 40+ year old men, I’m at my very early 20’s)
3) I have 10 days of PTO a year including sick days
4) My manager is very annoying
5) The company doesn’t have the structure and management that I’m looking for
6) Like most people in their 20’s I want to work for an established company where I can build a career. My role here is unchallenging and doesn’t intellectually stimulate me.
7) I’m going to sound like a dick, but I genuinely think I’m more professional and smarter than my co-workers including my manager.

1) Not enough work from home flexibility
2) Salary is okay, market rate average but I can probably earn more if I try

Need other's thoughts on this job application.,"Hello, just some background info; I am currently employed as an analyst for 3 years now for a big airline company, but we work offshore and we are outsourced so they can save money. The work itself keeps me interested enough to stay, and the pay is fine but the opportunities for learning and growth are quite limited, and I think it's a dead end job. Because of this, I've been applying for other positions related to my current job preferrably still in the aviation industry. 

So around the first week of August, a recruiter from another big airline company in my country contacted me via linkedin and asked if I was available for an interview. I said yes, then the interview happened 4 hours later from when I said yes. This was an HR interview and it went very well, we talked about my qualifications, why I was leaving, my expected salary and all that. They also asked me what I think I need to improve with my skills for this position- I answered it would be my knowledge on business inteligence tools like Tableau or PowerBI as I do not use these apps at my current work. So they then endorsed me to the hiring managers and gave me a piece of advice that I should just let them know that I am willing to learn.

I really prepared myself for the next round of interview- prepared some answers, researched about the company, and even watched introductions to Tableau on Youtube. I was advised there was also a practical exam with MS Excel so I prepared for that as well. (I use excel at my current job so I'm pretty good at it- but we don't really use it for data visualization). Fast forward to interview day, my interviewers were the manager of the department I was applying for, and the Director of Safety. I was a nervous wreck. The questions they asked me are very technical and were not what I really do in my current job. My current job is more heavily focused on programming to collect data and build reports, while the job I'm applying for is heavily focused on data analysis. My confidence came crashing down and I started doubting myself if I was even qualified for the role. I fucked up the practical Excel exam as well, i failed to do a simple line chart with 2 series of data, while they were watching. Long story short, I felt like I bombed this interview and I really did not establish a rapport with them. They did not give me a decision timeline, only that they will be deliberating on my interview and let me know of the results. Knowing I fucked up, I sent a thank you mail to the hiring managers and added a few notes on some questions I answered miserably during the interview.

So it's been a week since the interview, and I haven't heard back from them. I followed up on the HR person who contacted me (who is very responsive btw) yesterday, but I still have not gotten a response. I think I won't get the job, but as long as they haven't sent me a ""we regret"" mail, there's some little hope in me that there's still some chance. The work i currently have aligns with this new role, just probably more on the data analytics side of things. So what do you guys would think? Not even sure if there's a point to asking this, probably just needed a place to vent. I really want this job and it's made me anxious lol.",jobs,1.0

Which job offer should I accept?,"I currently work in financial forecasting for my company. I enjoyed the role and scope as i consolidated all of North America profit and loss statement.

My goal is to get into the financial service side (banks), or hedge funds/private equity. My current compensation is 83.5k with 10% bonus up to 16% stretch, 5% 401k and unlimited days off. Total comp this year would be around 100k. Also, my team is now in a different office so most likely I would not need to go in, but if i do its about an hour commute.

I have recently received 2 job offers on the same day and not sure what i should accept or not accept. Company 1 is arguably the strongest retail name. The scope is very attractive as its sales and expense forecasting of all North America as well as budgeting when a new store opens. Very much in the business and overall interesting. However, I do not find working in retail, I know its corporate, as something I strive to achieve. My salary would be 110k but that is it, no bonus and only 3.5% 401k match after 90 days. 10 days of PTO, 3 personal days and 7 sick days, the days are also accrued and not given right away. Also, there is an equinox membership. Basically bottom barrel benefits. Commute is 20min by subway or 10min by bike. so VERY easy commute. Possibly a better social atmosphere as well? though nothing is certain about that.

Company 2 is a strong biotech company that the job description is not as ""fancy"" as my current role and Company 1. I would do expense forecasting and allocation for their HR and Legal department. Nice experience but definitely different scope to what i currently do and have the option for Company 1. The compensation is definitely one of the most attractive I have seen. Base pay is 102k with a 5k signing bonus (must stay 2 years to not have to forfeit it). 10% bonus with up to 16% stretch, also 5% 401k match and then there is company stock option worth about 20k a year currently. total comp (not including stretch bonus) gets to around 142k after 1 full year of employment. Also, has 18 PTO and between Christmas and new years the office is closed. They provide other benefits like student tuition if i want to get my masters and such. However, this would be an hour 20min commute 2-3 times a week. So i would be giving up 3 hours of my day going to and from work. Healthcare for all 3 is pretty similar.

So what would you do if you were in my shoes and why? I would like to emphasize my goal of going into the financial service industry as my career goal. I have also had interviews in said industries but they are much more competitive. Thank you in advance for any insight!",jobs,1.0
How long should you wait for a job offer to be made?,"So I have been interviewing with this company (let’s call it X) for about 4 weeks now. For a bit of context: it’s a mid-senior level job, which asked for 3+ years experience in a similar role. My background is not in the same field as I have been doing research at university and recently completed a PhD, however I think my experience has been somewhat related to what they do which is why they called me.

After the first phone call I did my technical interview, which I passed and then they told me I did well in. I then had a behavioural interview, which I also passed and they told me I did well in. Lastly I had a final interview with upper level management and it also seemed to go well, I think I got along pretty well with everyone that I spoke to, people seemed to like me. This happened over a span of 3 weeks, so they have moved pretty fast compared to every other job I have applied for in the past 8 months. They also mentioned they were looking for someone to start asap as the job requires some training.

On Thursday, HR person calls me to tell me the managers had gone through my reference check and that it all went well, and that I should be hearing from them within 24 hours with a response on whether they would give me an offer or not. On Friday I waited all day, very nervously, checking the time and the phone, emails, etc. all day. No contact at all. No emails, no calls. Then 10 minutes before 5:00pm, I get a call from the HR person again telling me that they are waiting on 1 out of 2 signatures from upper management to sort out the contract/paperwork stuff, but that I am their preferred candidate and I should be expecting an offer early next week at the latest.

I was happy about this for some time, but today I woke up thinking “seems odd that they would take this long to make an offer, they want someone to start asap and they know I need to give 4 weeks notice at my current job before starting with them. What if the truth is they sent an offer to another candidate, and they are just waiting to see whether they accept or not? Then in that case I am just a second choice in case the first person declines.”

I know this may sound overly paranoid but I have never gotten this far in an interview process on any job before, so I am kind of new to all of it.

"Am ""high-functioning"" autistic... Had to quit my last job and no idea where to go from here. Advice or help?","Hi guys. As the title states, I had to quit my last job. It was actually pretty easy and would've gotten me through the next 6 months at least, but I ended up having to quit for a couple reasons:

* Job was very noisy. Overly sensitive to auditory stimuli. I was allowed to try loop earplugs (dampens sound, but not the clarity), but they interfered with the job and I wasn't able to wear them anymore

* I wasn't able to properly communicate over phone/walkie-talkies. I have auditory processing disorder which means occasionally, someone can speak very clearly and loudly and it would still sounds like garbled words to me. It happens enough that I thought my hearing was going bad before I found it what it actually was. This makes phone calls/radio calls tough for me because I can't make out words behind the distortion. Asking someone to repeat over the radio 3 times was a normal occurrence.

I explained the situation with my superiors but they weren't able to provide accommodations. Well, they tried a bit, they gave me an earpiece for the walkie but it didn't solve the issue. I ended up just quitting as it was too stressful for me to be in an environment that is always putting me on the edge of a meltdown.

I'm really not sure where to go from here. I have been applying to WFH live chat support/data entry positions like crazy but haven't gotten anything back. Lots of people viewing my CV but no calls/texts back. Ideally I would like something that lets me mainly communicate by writing

My past experience highlight is retail management at a well-known grocer chain in the Southeast US (which I previously left for the job I just quit). Currently learning to program &amp; am gonna finish up 1 more IT certification soon..

Got an offer. Do I make the jump?,"Looking for internet advice and thoughts on what people would do here. 

I'm currently working for a company where I'm the head of my department. The company has abysmal pay rates, but we're a not-for-profit that has a lot of community impact. The people we recruit are generally 'misfit-ish' because of our lower abilities to pay and industry, but the company really has this 70's, hippie, 'make it happen' vibe. We struggle from a financial department, which means most departments are understaffed. I'm the head of HR for 270 employees, and I only have one other mid-level HR employee (who is great) to assist with the workload. Usually, my work life balance is trash. There's a lot of anxiety in the role in terms of how many fires we end up with. But when the role is calm, it's amazing. My boss strongly values me and trusts me to get my work done no matter what, and wants me to take advantage of that flexibility. So on calm weeks I can sleep in, work remote, handle personal stuff during the day, and generally relax. Until very recently, that came with a slight underpinning of anxiety though that I wasn't right there waiting for the crazy stuff to pop up. We have a lot of legacy employees who don't do their job in the slightest, and most of them are peers to me on the leadership level. That can be demotivational. But... At the heart of it, I love (most of) our people. 

I had applied to places a bit in the spring when things were nuts, but as the summer has gone on my applying has slowed. Recently, one company that I applied to a while ago called me and fell in love with me as a candidate. I was excited for them too. Until I learned that I would supervise someone they already had on staff, and that person is the person who used to have the role I have now at my current company that failed at it (crazy small world). I have some strong preconceived motions there after knowing what I walked into with my current role and what a mess it was. Anyway. This company made me an offer today, and well... It's a 53% raise over my current rate for a position 3 or 4 tiers down in the department. Their benefits are rich, but don't offer an HSA, and their 401k match is terrible. Otherwise, the benefits are comparable or better. I do have a good personal connection to the company's mission too. The company is about 750 employees right now and growing. When this company extended the offer, they also mentioned that I would be required to sign a non-compete and non-disparagement agreement, which isn't typical at all for HR.  

To complicate things, there's a third company that I've been in process with for over two months now that told me I would be getting an offer today for a similar position, and I love their benefits offerings. Less rich medical but has an HSA for future planning, and an AMAZING 401k match. But I honestly couldn't give a damn about the company mission. The people I've met, however, are fantastic. 

The reason I started looking in the first place was a better work life balance and a higher salary. I've had a tough time medically the past two years and the bills have really been mounting. I'm not a money focused person, but I am a quality of life and future focused person. 

I thought for sure I would be able to easily accept one of these roles, but now that I have the one offer, I'm feeling very attached to my current compan and this unbelievable flexibility. Am I being stupid? Like, do typical companies monitor your remote work so much now that they monitor your every move and keystroke? Additionally, the non-compete was weird to me. I already reached out to the third company to see if they're still planning on extending the offer and haven't heard back (not atypical - things have usually been a day or two behind what they've stated as the plan). I need to respond to the offer by the end of the day on Monday.",jobs,1.0

I feel like a measly $3.71 raise in five years in a spit in my face. 

Manager left his email open in his office. They just hired someone for $16.55 in a position below me. Less experienced than me. Guy doesn’t even have ASE certification. I do and had it for 2 years, aced the test first go. Did not get a raise for that because “it was a requirement for my position”. Sure, okay. 

Been working every department here and training people, covering for other outlets when the employees there screwed up the whole place. Just last two days I completely cleared a bunch of work that someone was taking over a month to do.

I’ve done a few interviews (definitely need more practice) but I’m worried that I’m applying too much?

How to address leaving my current job over a new one,"I work as a full time desktop support technician at a hospital making about $42k salary. Recently, I've been fed up with a lot of the shit my company has been doing behind a lot of the technician's backs and favoring certain groups of us over others. I've been working my ass off the two years I've been here and held up my team through and through. To make a long story short I'm basically a level 1 tech that takes on level 2 responsibilities majority of the time. When employee review time came around, I asked for a raise and was told that there simply wasn't enough in the budget to give anybody raises this year. Instead I was told that everybody was getting a small bonus of maybe $300 and everyone would be getting the same amount. I did get that bonus but funnily enough, my supervisor (who hates the company too and is not my actual boss technically), finds out that the techs at one of the other hospitals got raises and were told to keep things all hush hush. I already feel like I am being underpaid for the experience I have and the work that I've done for this company. So this nonetheless infuriated me. I've been lightly job hunting recently and found this one company that is similar and actually much closer to where I live and are offering $55k. This is the raise I deserve in my opinion and if I nail the interview and get the job I want to know how to bring it up to my current boss. One thing I do enjoy about my current job is the comfort of it. I know how things work here and I can get stuff done fairly efficiently. I've made a lot of connections here and know the users personally as well as a bunch of other people in IT here. So when I bring it up to my boss I definitely want to bring up the subject of matching that pay. However, I have a strong feeling the multi-billion dollar company will not be willing to lol. Which is fine, I'll gladly take on the new job at that point. I do want to bring up the fact that it was unfair that they secretly gave out raises to their handpicked favorites though. It seriously needs to be addressed...I guess my question is: Will mentioning that land me in any hot water?

Please do not just tell me to quit because this is practically my dream job (or will help me get into my dream position) and it's taken me 5 years to get where I am. I've also only been at this job for a few months so I'm still learning the company culture and everything. I love my work, but there's just 1 issue. 

I work at an educational facility (like a museum) that was built in a real shady part of town. It was built there because I'm sure the company I work for got the land cheap or even for free to help make the area nicer. However our facility is brand new, just a year old so we haven't been able to make any impact on the community yet. We are still growing and getting the word out that we exist. 

However, due to the location there are many people experiencing homelessness camped just outside our property. 

On a good day we just hear lots of unintelligible yelling outside our property. On an average day we get yelled at/ verbally harassed. It's especially bad for me and the other women that work there. And on a bad day we've had 1 employee get pushed and spat on by someone. After this incident we locked our gates and only allow people into our facility by appointment. 

It's been a month and our CEO wants us to open our gate to the public again. This means anyone can just walk in. This also means anyone has access to our bathrooms which also obviously led to issues in the past. A best case scenario I will be told how beautiful I am by creepy guys (I've made a previous post about how to deal with that). Worst case, I'll get physically assulted. 

My manager and director are on my side. They have tried advocating for me. But the CEO only cares about numbers and having us open to the public means we can tell our donors that we see 50 people a day (all homeless who just use our bathrooms) instead of our current average of 5 (a family that makes an appointment). 

What should I do to help us keep our gates closed. Or if we are forced to open what can I do to keep myself safe?

Timing two hiring processes at once,"I work in a bit of a niche profession and have recently moved to an area where there is a bit of a shortage. Employers rely on hiring from out of region, and there is a housing crisis here so new hires often don't stick. This means I am in a strong position since I am already here. It's also a very small world within my professional circles so it's really important to be honest and direct as much as possible. There are two jobs that have come up recently that I have applied for. 

Local Job: I informally met with the soon-to-be manager of this position a month ago. He told me that this position would be coming available and that they've had recent hiring challenges. The afternoon after meeting with me, he sent me a link to a brand new job posting that would be perfect for me. This job sounds interesting, is at my skill level, and is close enough I could walk. The posting closes today.

Out of Town (OT) Job: This job is still good. It's an hour commute but carpooling and remote work is available.

Need advice about quitting a new job,"I recently got employed at what I thought was my dream job, and I'm 5 days in and considering quitting. My family/friends think I should stick it out but its been really rough and I just want someone elses perspective... Here are some issues:

1. Micromanagement is really bad, my boss asked me to leave my desk for lunch today because the owners have cameras and he didnt want them to see me just sitting there not doing anything... I feel bad because the manager is also new and gets chewed out every single day, he just moved across the country for this job because they poached him... 

2. There's no training and IT department is non existent for a company that has 75 employees. It took 3 days to get my email and phone setup and they're still not working properly. My manager has spent 1.5 hours total with me, for the entire week.

3. Its a sales job, but its cutthroat. No leads or round robin calls, its fend for yourself. The main sales guy is remote and has been with the company for 10+ years. He out sells everyone by at least double. They have tasked me with building my own business, but I can't touch a single lead this top salesman has touched which is almost every well known company including local companies. Even if we do 0 business with the company and the lead has been untouched for 3+ years I still can't touch it because he sent an email years ago and still claims the lead even though he's not following up. Which makes things difficult because its the auto industry, there aren't that many new companies each year.

"But like, are they *really* that desperate for workers?","I applied to a local grocery store a couple of days ago. One that has a million signs out saying they need help and the pay starts at $11+ blah blah. So I applied for a cashier position and got a call back the next day for an interview. That’s great right? We both decide 5pm is best for both of us and schedule the interview for today. 

So 4:54 rolls around and I’m at customer service telling the girl that I have an interview at 5. She has a puzzled look on her face. Not a good sign. She gets on the walkie and signals a manager. I can clearly hear how confused they are and the manager tells her over the walkie to have the girl jot down my number and they’ll give me a call to reschedule. Um what? You desperately need people, but you decided that it would be okay to just shoo me away after I wasted my gas/time? 

So about 40 min ago I get a voicemail from the manager. She apologizes and says they “were just too busy to interview” me but we can reschedule for tomorrow. Then she has the gall to say that my availability  doesn’t match what she needs for a cashier, so can I be a direct shopper instead. My avail is 12pm-close, which is 11pm. Again, what? Do they just need openers cause if that’s the case, just put it on a sign or something.

My new response to being asked about job hopping.,"I recently had an interview where one of the interviewers said they were concerned that I was a habitual. For some background, I am on my 4th job out of college in almost ten years and the jobs looked like this:

&gt;2012 - design engineer
&gt;2015 - project engineer
&gt;2017 - sales engineer
&gt;2021 - sr sales engineer (moved 1000 miles to be closer to wife's family)

New job I am interviewing for would be a 30% bump in base and potential 70% bump in ote comp so it was a no brainer to interview for it. 

My response that I gave was every job up until this last one was a very different job and I only took this last one to move with my wife. I thought that was an ok response but after a beer this evening I came to the realization that if I hadn't hopped jobs and take the path that I did, I would hardly be qualified for this new job and probably wouldn't even get  an interview. 

So that's my new answer. If I didn't take the path I did you wouldn't even be interviewing me right now. Wish I thought of it when asked but I will be ready for next time!

Now whether I get the job is another story. I think they are getting cold feet since I was the first person they interviewed with but my background fits the position kind of perfectly. Now they are saying they want to interview a couple internal people first but who knows. They can't string me along forever.

Not seeing the forest for the trees,"Catharsis time.

When applying for jobs over the past 6 months for mid-level, consulting positions, I've realized a few things.  Outside of knowing someone within the company or being actively recruited for a specific position, I believe the following rules apply:

As long as you have the right ""amount"" of experience, nothing you did previously or accolades/triumphs that you received mean a hill of beans.  Sorry but potential employees just do not care...

Most of the time, the people you interview have a ""check-list"" that everything is govern off of.  They ask generic HR questions and really that is all you are judged on.  I have noticed that lots of people with 5 to 10 years of experience within an industry are passed over by someone greener merely because they gave ""better answers"" to their moronic queries.

Case in point.  It was down to me and another for a regional consulting position and they wanted us to give presentations and wanted one person said was a ""teach-back.""  Granted no topics or structure was given yet was just told to teach about something/anything.  I then received the dreaded Friday call that they are moving ahead with the other candidate with the sole reasoning being the presentation (everything else they said was outstanding).  Apparently, they wanted more of a ""teach-back"" method which included asking the audience to repeat their understanding to you.  Again, there was no clear instructions or format and I did ask prior what exactly they wanted and was told, ""just talk about something you know.""

So I am 95% sure they are hiring someone with less experience in the industry because of a presentation with realistically means nothing in the grand schemes of things. Ughhhhhhhhhhhh",jobs,1.0

Did I dodge a bullet?,"I’ve been interviewing for a nonprofit job I’m extremely passionate about because it correlates to my lived experience.

I knew the two interviewers because I have volunteered for the organization for a few years. Everything seemed to be going very well but I did have a weird gut feeling about what happened to the woman whose job I would be taking over. I know her causally through social media and thought she left on her own accord. I know I should have asked about why the position was vacant but I also didn’t want to rock the boat too much because I’ve been out of work for a while and this truly seemed like my dream job. 

One month after being courted heavily by the entire team and being asked to submit a writing sample, I realized that I had been ghosted with no feedback. It hurt a lot because of my personal connections to the org and because I really thought I would excel at the job. 

I reached out to the woman whose job I would have been taking and she confirmed she was fired. She also  (very expectedly) told me she didn’t have a great experience there. I came into the conversation with full awareness that she could be biased, but she said that the CEO was abusive not only to her, but to other employees as well and that her leadership made for a very toxic organization. It’s a very small org (under ten FT employees) and I know from experience that a toxic leader can have immense negative consequences on a company culture, especially for one so small. The woman also said they don’t value innovation and I am someone who scores high on ideation in StrengthsFinder. To be honest, I sensed some red flags in the interviews, but kept trying to push past them because I felt so passionate about the mission and liked the pay.

I’ve been ruminating a lot because upon further reflection, I think my writing sample ultimately did me in and know I probably could have submitted stronger work. But I also think I may have dodged a serious bullet. Thoughts or input?",jobs,1.0

Is job or location more important when considering job offers?,"Is Job or Location more important when considering multiple job offers?

I have been looking around for a new job, and I am early in my career and in my early 20s. I received two job offers that I am contemplating between. 

Job A is at a large multinational company in a field that is new to me, so it gives me a chance to learn something new. I enjoyed the interview process at this company, and have gotten a chance to speak to people that I would work with if I joined, and they all seem great. 

Job B is with another international corporation that is really well known. The interview process for this job was a bit more disorganized and chaotic but the people again seemed really nice. 

Here's my dilemma: Job A is located in a big city that I have already previously lived in and it is giving me the opportunity to get exposure to a new field. 

Job B is similar to the work I already do and I'm not sure I feel too excited about the job duties but it is in a field with a hot technology that the whole world is raving about and it's located in an even bigger city that I've dreamed of living in since I was a kid. 

Both companies are offering me around the same amount. 

In terms of the actual job, I get better vibes about Job A and I don't mind the city it's in, but Job B is in a newer field in my dream city.

what to do if you’re getting fired for a job that gave you no relevant experience,"my job is data entry disguised as analysis. I am due to be fired in about a month, or next week at my PIP check-in. i will be fired for incompetence and lack of communication about my incompetence. (incompetence = low productivity rate. they hired the person who had the job before me at part-time. I do not measure up to her speed after a year and a half. i also make mistakes and ask too many questions.)

Bc my title is “analyst” but 90% of my job is data entry, I am fucked on 2 levels: my experience is shit, and I’m getting fired at an “easy” job. this more or less fucks my chance at ever getting hired again. 

the only thing I can sell is “I can write queries because I am very familiar with what people say,” but bc my experience is not industry-specific and I will be fired, every hiring manager and recruiter has grilled me over “well what do you actually do?” and then stops speaking to me after I explain that my job is noticing whether a person says their food was good or bad and putting a 1 or 0. 

idk why i am posting. this shit is just hopeless. 6 months of applying to get 1 interview and then rejected not 3 hours later because “she doesn’t have a real reason to work here,” despite discussing at length how writing queries and writing reports is what i enjoy.

i guess i can give you a word of warning - don’t get your fucking degree in math. and don’t get one in econ either. I have both and they haven’t meant shit in corporate. every “math” or “econ” job is just a statistical CS job, and if your school doesn’t teach you how to script in SQL or R or Python, you’re fucked, and even if you do, any math job that isn’t data entry requires about 5 years of experience and a masters to get interviewed. just get your degree in finance, at least that’s fucking hirable.",jobs,1.0

I couldn’t reach her by phone so I replied an email to politely decline - saying I wanted to have some #1 experience first and would appreciate it if they could reconsider my application in the future if there’s an opportunity.
However, I didn’t send an email to any other person I talked to in the interview and I feel bad. I thought about sending a thank-you email to each person but I was not sure if it’d be appropriate since the hiring manager did not include anyone in the job offer email.
In hindsight, I should’ve sent it especially to the supervisor with whom I had a great time speaking.
It’s been almost a month after I declined. I might accidentally burn bridges now. Do you guys think I should reach out to them or just move on? I am pretty sure they did move on because they can easily find other good candidates to fill the position. But the company is growing and I would like to keep the door open. 
How do I appropriately say? 
Any comments would be appreciated.
Thank you.

TL;DR Got offered a job that I have 5 YOE, sent an email only to hiring manager to decline because wanted to pivot to another role with another company but may reapply in future. Feel bad I did not include the supervisor I had a great time talking to in the interview. A month has passed, should I reach out, if so, what should I say?",jobs,1.0
Where am I supposed to get dressed when going from class to work?,"Not really sure where to post this but I hope you guys might have some advice. I have about 50 minutes from the end of class to the beginning of work. For class, I wear street clothes but my work requires me to get dressed in business professional. My commute home from class is \~20 minutes + \~5 minute walking time to my car and my commute from my house to work is \~20 minutes, so a total of \~45 minutes. This means I have 5 minutes to get dressed and be ready which I think is a near impossibility.

Is disclosure helpful or harmful in an interview?,"Back in July I applied to two jobs within the same week. Job A got back to me, and I was hired, I’ve been here for about 3 weeks.

Just got promoted and received 7k raise but getting a job offer for 30k/year more... what do i do?,"First of all, let me start by saying I like my company and my boss. 

I started a year ago. Everyone got a small bump in Jan 2020, about 2.5%. I started exploring my options (interviews) due to financial reasons (debt, supporting parents etc). While my company pays the standard wage for someone in my position. I know most other (bigger) companies pay at least 10k more and some even pay 40k more.

I asked my boss for a raise 3 months ago.. and this week, I got promoted this week and received a 7k pay bump (on top of the 2.5% in jan). Honestly I was kinda disaapointed as I asked for 10k more. I have been doing essentially 2-3 person job and projects that would have been outsourced to outside vendors and would have cost the company 50-60k if it weren't for me.

My boss did say to me, there's a good chance I might receive another pay bump in the beginning of next year. I'm guessing another 2.5%. but the other company is offering 30k. Obviously I can't turn it down and this would help my financial issues tremendously. But what do I say to my boss especially since I just received a pay bump and a promotion? What if they give me a counter offer? 

Another factor is also the people I work with in my department are kinda slow, don't really care for their work and workflows could be much better. In short, I often end up fixing their mistakes or picking up their work.",jobs,1.0
My first real job starts soon ! (UK),"I am so proud of myself because even though I'm only 26, I have had worked 7 very different jobs now...5 in the last 3 years, and none of them panned out. They all were dead ends and learning experiences.

I feel inclined to quit my job because everyone is leaving and the new policies are ridiculous.,"I’ve worked at the same place for two years (an ice cream shop) and over the past 3-4 months my general manager got in some hot water after an assessment and started enforcing some ludicrous rules. One of which is now we  sign forms before using equipment so if it breaks the last person to use it can pay for it. Same goes for the safe, we sign off on counting the safe so if it is short we can pay the difference. Also, we aren’t allowed to keep tips anymore and instead put them into a tip pool. 

The straw that broke the camels back is that people weren’t counting the safe cause they didn’t wanna sign off and be responsible for any discrepancies. A disgruntled ex-coworker took the tip bag when he quit (it had all the money we got since we started the tip pool) and since we didn’t count the safe for a week no one knew until my gm went to deposit our tips that it was missing. Everyone left over these new policies, it’s just me, one other shift lead, my GM, and the AGM. The GM and AGM are beyond stressed and taking it out on the two of us remaining. The AGM is usually cool but he lives with the GM because he’s married to her daughter and things have gotten messy with the new stress so now they fight constantly. Also, the shop recently got banned from advertising snag a job and indeed for reports of violating labor laws (working minors past 4 hours without a break, and too late on school nights) so we haven’t even found new hires for a month. 

All of this and I start my next semester of college next week. I can’t help but feel that I didn’t really need this in my life. It takes a toll on my self esteem to be the GM and AGM’s punching bag. It’s just constant yelling and screaming at this point between the two of them.",jobs,1.0
How long should you stay at a company before deciding to leave if you’re unhappy?,"I started this job 4 months ago and have not enjoyed even 1 day of work.

Yesterday I got a call from a government agency offering a phone interview, but they set the date and time. I told them I couldn’t do it at that time and that I’m only available on weekdays outside of business hours and on my lunch break. They wouldn’t make any arrangements that would fit my schedule. They asked if I would take a 30 minute break or the morning off to do the interview, and I explained that unfortunately my job doesn’t work that way and I didn’t feel that it was professional to interview for another job while at work. After some awkward silence, I politely declined the interview because they would not work with me on my schedule. 

Also, this doesn’t really matter but it’s worth mentioning that I don’t recall applying for this job and could find nothing about it in my history on indeed. I’m skeptical, but it was definitely legitimate because the phone number was truly for that government agency. I guess I could have filled out a general application or something? I know absolutely nothing about the position and it may not be anything like what I’m looking for. Had I recognized the job they wanted to interview me for, I may have tried to make arrangements. 

Should I have done more to accommodate them because it was a government job? Are they more strict? I felt good about declining yesterday, but now I’m wondering if I screwed up.

How to navigate personal relationships and friendships as a new manager?,"Hi all. I’m only 27 but have come into a management role on my team since it’s been small but we are doubling in size.

The awkward thing is they’re all around my age and are like people I’d be friends with. We haven’t had many young women on my team ever, so it’s a new experience.

Should I (F21) leave my job and focus on finishing my degrees?,"Hey! So I work part-time as an animal care technician at an animal shelter. This is a physically demanding job, everyone is constantly sweating and running around the building to do things. I’ve had the job for two months now and it completely drains my energy whenever I work. 
A few days ago I started classes again. This is my final year completing my BS and MA degrees in Biology. I have to do my classes and complete a master’s thesis on my personal time. I have never had a job while in school and feel like it will be too much for me. My boss will not guarantee a weekend day off, so that means I would be going to class or working every day. 
I do love being around the animals and having some sort of income. I also have never had a job last longer than 2 months (they were all summer jobs) and I am worried that will look bad on my resume. That’s another reason why I’ve thought about staying, but working there is exhausting. I can’t imagine having to study or write papers after working a shift, cause all I ever want to do is shower and sleep afterwards. What do you all think I should do?

Leaving a negative review online for a company - Consequences? (Harrassment/Bullying),"I'll try to keep this short but this has been on my mind for quite a while now. I need to speak up.

Worked in a highly toxic environment for 1.5 years. Small company, about 10 employees. In just 18 months, got sexually harassed (guy was out the door the minute they learned though, only positive thing in there I can outline) but was overall bullied by a group of individuals on a daily basis. Serious anger issues, threats in front of everyone for absolutely no reason, one male who was taking pride in refusing to talk to women without anyone batting an eye (and would communicate only in writing with the female manager as a result) - I was the youngest by far as I was a new graduate and everyone was twice my age in there, I suspect people feared that?? Management did not care about all the drama as they were too busy hanging out at weekly golf tournaments drinking their venti Starbucks frapuccinos instead of being in the office, while leaving the rest of the team in dirty-as-fuck offices where cleaning was not a thing with people constantly getting sick (oh and we also had to buy our own coffee pot, beans, milk and whatnot as this was ""too expensive"" for the company to afford, coming from a manager owning a Hummer). Sick days were coming out of your holiday too so basically no one would really go anywhere. I was hired to target a specific market in the country (multilingual) and was yelled at by other employees for being ""rude"" and not speaking English only in the open space, yet they would talk shit all day about my physical appearance and whatnot in their own language next to me. I could go on way longer about it all... This was a serious shitshow and caused serious amounts of anxiety. When I inevitably left to save my sanity, management essentially begged me to not mention anything about the workplace to anyone.

Anywho, I know for a fact the same group of individuals is still working there at the moment (this was three years ago). I want to make sure no future employee ever goes through a tenth of the crap I had to put up with there. Without of course citing names, is that ok for me to lay out the facts on Glassdoor etc. (i.e. harrassment and bullying and management's acceptance and disregard towards it all)? The events took place in Canada if that helps.

Annoyed by HR - They just straight up lie at every interview,I’ve only met one genuine HR person - she was a recent grad like me and seemed to be sincere. The rest always end up lying to me or being slimy. At every interview they ask me what my expected salary would be. I try to dodge this question but they insist. I give a range that’s plus/minus a deviation of the average salary online. They always say they are looking at below that range. I’ve had multiple HR say that they we’re choosing someone with more experience but they will be opening other positons later for me. A week later when I follow up they ghost me and it never works out. I’ve had HR ask me what engineering terms on my resume mean because they don’t know. One person said they are looking for someone who is willing to stay in a positons 15 Years because it’s expensive to train for it - a positon working only night shifts and exposed to radiation. Another HR cut me off whenever I spoke and didn’t actually answer any of my questions. One day a recruiter called me and we ended up talking - she gave me some advice and told me that a lot of the time HR will just throw out resumes they don’t understand and that I should bypass them and find a way to talk to  hiring managers.

Boss asking me to pick up extra Saturday shifts?,"I'm an second shift worker at a job that needs to be staffed 24/7/365. I like my job but it tends to be a transitional position for people looking to go on to bigger and better things in the industry and at the moment we're getting hit by a lot of people leaving at once.

Just had my first ever Job interview as an apprenticeship (Fitness Trainer) at a local gym.,"SO I sent my documents for this gym as an  apprenticeship 3 days ago and got a call yesterday for an interview. I made an appointment for today which was 1 hour ago, and informed myelf very well about this gym what programs they do etc). It went pretty well I think. 

It began with an offer for a coffee or something, which I of course did not reject. The responsible person then showed me the gym and such. I of course practised the most common questrions which might come up, and exactly these were asked today.

I applied myself as an  apprenticeship , since I am still a teenager who just finished school. She said if I would want to work in the gym to see how it is, or want to make an education for this.

Can I negotiate my salary up?,"Hello lovely people!  I am seeking advice on how to navigate a conversation about negotiating up an offer.

1. I applied for a position and got a call back from the recruiter last Thursday.  He asked me screening questions, including ""What are your salary requirements?""  I had the range in my head already based on market research:  $73-77k. I asked him ""What is the salary range for this position?""  He looked it up for me:  $65-70k, and asked if that was what I was expecting.  I said (nervously, as I had not negotiated my salary before) ""I was thinking $73k and up."" he said there might be room for that but the Hiring Manager would be the one to make that decision.  He forwarded my name anyway.  
2. I interviewed on Monday.  Interview went great, they were very transparent and we vibed a lot.  I had a strong feeling they were going to make an offer.  They asked for my timeline, the piece they needed before they can make an offer.  I followed up with them the very next morning.  They said they'll make an offer by the end of the week.
3. This morning I was asked to get on a quick phone call.  Told me they accidentally missed a step - before they can give a formal offer they had to give me a verbal offer.  They offered $73k, and asked if I was cool with that.  I asked about benefits.  He shared a bit (they're all slightly better than my current gig), and he said he would send me the benefits guide with all the health insurance plans.  I never directly answered his question about whether or not I would agree to $73k because I was trying really hard to hold off on answering to assess everything and see if I can ask for more.

"I don't know what I want to do for a living, but I need a permanent job I enjoy.","I don't know what I want to do for a living, but I need a permanent job I enjoy.

**Note to readers:** Anything I describe with regards to employment and legalities will be UK-based, so while I welcome advice from users who are unfamiliar with what goes on in the UK, I apologise in advance that your ability to help me will be limited.

I'm currently working as a staff bank administrator for my local NHS hospital, and one of the concerns I've been having is how I'm unable to perform to the standard that the hospital requires - my current placement, which takes place at night (I don't have a problem with this unless I end up sleeping for too long to reduce the amount of free time I have before work) requires me to move packs of hospital supplies to roll cages so a team of distributors can supply the hospital with them on the day they're needed. The problem is, I'm having trouble working to the pace required to move these packs - one of my coworkers has noted my lack of interest too in this position and recommended me to change careers. Currently I will require to work with them for as long as they can't find a replacement, as I'm effectively taking on a position left by one or two retirees.

The other problem is, I'm *very* picky with where I want to work; on the other hand, I'm *very* much against the idea of turning my hobby or passion into a business - I'll explain this a bit later. Here's what I want from my full-time job:

- **Non-profit:** looking at what big private companies get away with, I don't feel like I can find it acceptable to wholeheartedly throw myself into such a work environment and I've just become very jaded with society. I have issues with current intellectual property law too and don't believe it's within my good conscience to work in a job that benefits from it. This is all why I wanted to work for the NHS in the first place, even though the jobs themselves can be demanding as it's a healthcare position. I am likely to need to compromise on this position but I don't know by how much.
  
- **Working on site:** I feel too distracted working from home - that said I'd like the organization to offer both options, and it would be best too for them to offer both options because of the pandemic.
  
- **LGBT+ friendly:** I have personal issues relating to gender and would much prefer it if coworkers can take this into consideration. Unfortunately the UK's attitudes towards especially transgender people isn't terribly great, and one of the most prominent LGBT+ organizations in the country is a for-profit (Stonewall).
  
- **Either a chance to be able to make friends and socialize with them or working alone if that's impossible:** if I'm gonna spend 8 hours a day for the rest of my life (almost, if I could ever retire), I'd like to not feel like my social life is dead and I'd love to be able to talk to people I can trust - if socialization is not practical for the job, I'd rather work in a role where I am alone for most of the day so I don't ever get the temptation to socialize with coworkers and so I may better be able to focus on work.
  
- **Not working with people:** I'm not sure if I'd like to be one of those sales people at the door in supermarkets and other shops that like in the US, shops here in the UK have recently insisted on having. I prefer to work with people whom I can trust and usually just talk with staff if I can. This may also rule me out of working for like LGBT+ organizations as I'd simply not like to work with people.
  
- **Low intensity:** this cannot be guaranteed and will otherwise be hard to find, but I struggle to work effectively under pressure. When I feel very anxious or like I'm a burden or whatever, I struggle to listen and remember simple instructions. I would like a job that's slower paced.


I am against the idea of turning my hobby, passion or project into a business. Granted, I wanted to stream on Twitch, but even if I were OK with the platform's association with Amazon, it's not a guaranteed reliable source of a good income, Twitch is already saturated with streamers who call this their full-time job and sole source of income, there's more paperwork I'd have to conduct myself as a Twitch streamer and I don't feel like I should put myself out there. I am even less open to having a career with YouTube. I would rather not turn a hobby, passion or project into a business primarily because of IP law or something to that effect - I would risk the integrity of any of my passion projects and it would conflict with my values. I also do not want something like ownership of some IP to be transferred to a company (even if it were one I make) and would rather it were freely shareable or something.

I've realised that driving may be one of the best jobs for me, but I don't have a driving license and I'm unlikely to be able to afford driving tests for some time - I'd rather save to move out first. Even then a lot of jobs that require drivers are for private companies like Amazon, Uber and Royal Mail. Being a delivery driver would also require me to be physically fit (I sometimes lack the stamina required for my current role and sometimes feel anxious and/or sleepy). The fact that driving is a male-dominated job would feed further into my gender issues.

I kind of lack the motivation to program on a serious level with medium sized or large projects, and sometimes feel intimidated by it all - I'd love to work mostly on open projects but few companies have embraced open source, and would again prefer to program out of love and not for money. This is not to mention too that most programming projects are for private companies who rely on keeping their code in-house, and while programming has various transgender employees, the whole field is still otherwise male-dominated.

A family friend recommended I worked for local government but I would also feel like I would be part of the problem too, as much as working for a for-profit private company.

One time I even considered serving in the military because it would keep me away from parents, but I would not be physically and mentally capable of the position and I have no interest in what the military and/or any country stands for - I'd only find the experience valuable with regards to the skills I can learn but some of them can be picked up outside the military setting too.

Even if I could find a job I'm worried that I may lack the skills to work in it. I conceded to attending university because I lacked professional skills and my parents and school wanted to me to. I don't know if there's a lot I can do to improve my lack of professional skills. My degree is in game development, and I'm no longer very interested in working with the games industry. I've considered finding private courses perhaps, but if I'm gonna be unemployed they may be kind of a risky expense, especially if I get around to moving out.

I'm also on Universal Credit and will intend to be for a long while - I need it in order to pay for housing if my income levels ever dip to a level that's not high enough; it'd be handy too for me to pay for therapy.

If there's anything that comes up I'll try and describe it as soon as possible although my night shifts can make this somewhat difficult.

Got my dream job!!!!,"Just have to share with someone :) 

I am in shock and can't believe this is truly happening. After stagnating for a while at my current job (overworked and waiting on a promotion that seems to never come), I got an offer for a job that is  directly aligned with my career goals and a $33k raise! I started looking around the fifth time I asked for a promotion - perhaps a lesson for you managers out there.

I love the team I work with and am sad to leave but I cannot turn down this opportunity. I just signed the offer letter and planning to put my two weeks in today. I don't have any arrests or things to worry about with the background check but for some reason my anxiety brain is telling me this is too good to be true. Fingers crossed that all goes well and I'm so looking forward to starting my new job in two weeks!

Severance/NDA even though I was the one who quit? Is this Normal?,"Hi! 

I recently left my employer for a better opportunity. It was on good terms and after a 2 weeks notice. They sent me a severance offer along with an NDA that waives my right to sue for discrimination, a non-disparagement clause, and all the stuff that you'd expect in a severance NDA.

Looking elsewhere and the guilt involved,"I've been working IT at my current place for about four years, my manager started around the same time so we both were fresh to the company and have now worked together for years, as you can imagine we've become good friends, he's helped me with plenty of personal stuff and I think because we're a team of two and this is my first proper job out of university I feel a lot of loyalty to him and this place.

But there's nothing else for me here, my pay could probably go up a little but not as much as I'd like, I've taken on extra responsibilities but because of Covid there's been no talk of payrises since before the pandemic, I feel like I'm squandering my twenties by staying here for so long yet I still have this pit in my stomach about the guilt of leaving here.

Any similar stories? I don't hate my job, but more often than not I find myself bored at work nowadays, I've not got any passion for this place. I've got an interview lined up at a place a bit further away commute-wise but hopefully the pay will off-set that and I can discuss WFH possibilities.

I dont know if this is the right subreddit to post this. So 1 month ago i had an interview for an entry level job (it was me first  interview ever). It went pretty well. They even asked me when i am gonna  be available to start working and what salary i am expecting.

They  told me that they were gonna keep interviewing candidates till the  first week of August. After the first week of August (August 8th) I  contacted them and asked them when they would get back to me about the  job (if they want me or no) and they told me that the hiring process is  still ongoing and was extended until mid August so they cannot provide  any feedback.

Now its August 19th and still no contact from them. What should I expect? Should i make 1 last call?

Applying for/Working two jobs?,"BLUF: Currently working a 9-5 job in IT within the financial services industry. Pretty niche role, pays well (just about six figures). My husband is about to return to school, and while he'll be going on the GI bill (which comes with certain financial entitlements), money is still going to be tight.

Mortgage payment, tolls for both of us (gotta love the Mid-Atlantic region) will be about $500/month, car payments, insurance, gas, and on and on goes the list.

Every so often, I mentally toy with the idea of getting a second job. My question, though, is this: how do you guys market your resume when you work in a pretty niche role/field? If I were to get a second job, I'm not necessarily looking for another six-figure job. Just another 2-3K/month to bring in some extra money.

A couple of days ago, the person who is the ultimate hiring authority (I think) and would be my boss, emailed me to ask if I had any questions about the interview.

I was fired because no one liked me but they gave me six weeks to clean out my desk. Is this crazy?,"If you were fired but were given 6 weeks to clean out your desk would you stick it out? 

My boss told me **over and over and over again** how terrible my personality was and how NO ONE LIKED ME in the office.  It did wonders for my self-worth and confidence! (I thought I was being nice to everyone and could not get my boss to give me true examples or talk to anyone about it.)

He demanded that I resign and when I said no, he froze me out for two weeks while he worked with Human Resources to come up with the paperwork and justification to fire me.  Eventually, I was called into the Human Resources Director's office where my boss and her tagged team me and strongly asked for my resignation.  I again refused.

After much anger and discussion, when I said countless times that I was nice to everyone and no one had ever given me any indication I was mean or unhelpful to them, I was offered the ability to stick around for 6 weeks while I looked for a new job.  Or I could leave immediately and get six weeks of severance pay.

**Which option would you choose?**  Staying for six weeks would give me the chance to aggressively look for a new job while I was still officially employed and keeping my health benefits.  Leaving immediately and collecting 6 weeks in severance pay in a lump sum check would give me freedom from that toxic place but I would be officially jobless which would make my hunt for a new position difficult.",jobs,1.0

Do you agree with my bosses statement?,"I’m new to a job been there about four months. But I feel like it’s a repeat of my last job, I hate hate getting correction. I feel like I’m just becoming more and more defensive over the years. Anyway around two weeks ago I got really upset and broke down with my boss. It was crying not arguing. And she told me that I’m one of the better people she’s trained in this position, compared to the other people there before me that were also there for a longer time. I was at my last job for two years and got correction/redirection often and am ultimately trying to avoid that. I just fear and know it will happen 

But what I told my boss was that I feel I should not need her help or be in contact with her less. I have been in contact with her more since I started, she said that’s what she expects.

I’m my bosses single employee but working with her is hell. I don’t want to leave her alone but I don’t know what else to do,"
At times it can be a relaxed and laid back environment, but most of the time it’s hell. She’s extremely disorganized/scatterbrained and no matter how much I have tried to help get her organized nothing works. 

I have organized nearly everything business related and came up with new systems and ways of staying on top of things but nothing helps and it almost seems like my boss wants the business to fail. We will plan out the next day and everything that we are doing but the next day comes and my boss has completely forgotten everything we talked about and most of the time wants to change everything up. She writes down to do lists but then puts them in a large pile where they just disappear. 

I have created invoices for our customers but she never sends them out and sometimes forgets who owes her what no matter how I organize the financials. For example, she recently gave someone an invoice for last years service and saw no issue with it. 

 I’ve also screened well over 30 future applicants but nothing has came from either of those. She begs for extra help but always finds something wrong with other applicants and I’m currently the only employee because of this.

Then theres the absolute shitshow that’s my scheduling. I never know when I’m working until the 6am the morning of. There’s many weeks where she will tell me we are working on these days so I make plans for my off days. Then I wakeup the day of for work,start driving to work and then I’m told we’re not working that day and she will need me to rearrange my plans and work on my off days. Just today I was told to get there at 8am but she just called and told me she won’t be ready until 11am.

When we actually do work my equipment frequently breaks down because she forgets to have someone come fix it.

I’ve also shown up to jobs sites and had customers turn me away because she never gave them a price for our services.

She also frequently forgets what customers need our services/have been waiting the longest. Some of the customers on our to do list have been waiting well over 5-6 months but she has not gotten back with them. 

I don’t know what to do anymore, my jobs pays well (whenever we actually work) and I don’t want to leave her by herself but I’m at a loss of what to do. I’ve tried helping her anyway that I can but there’s nothing else I can do to help her.

Just needed to get that off my chest

Edit:forgot to add there are many times where she forgets to pay me and I have to repeatedly ask for it. 

Edit 2:Also forgot that she texts and calls me constantly even on off days just to tell me what’s going on with the business and what her plans are for that day business related or not.",jobs,1.0

Everyone at my job is WAY older than me :(,I just started a new job a couple days ago. Kind of a rocky start( some difficult electrical work but I’m trying to give it more time for me to adjust. My issue is that everyone here is like 20+ years older than me. I’m 22 years old. There is only one guy that is in my age group but he doesn’t even work in my department sadly. So basically I have no one to relate or talk to. Most of them have families already etc. I just feel a bit out of place being the youngest. I don’t think I’ll ever be able to connect with anyone really since of the huge age gaps. In the past I’ve worked jobs where everyone was my age and we could joke around and have a good time. But all these older people are just so serious that I often feel sad because it’s like I’ll never be able to have as much fun as I did at my previous jobs. The pay is (20 per hour) which isn’t much but it’s more than I’ve ever been paid at my previous jobs. I just don’t know if this is a good enough reason to quit the job. Or maybe I should I just accept this as just work and find a social life elsewhere? But then I think about how I spend 8 hours a day here so that leaves very little time for anything else. I just don’t know what to do I just miss my old job where I had tons of friends and we would hang out and stuff. Now that’s over and I just feel so lonely.,jobs,1.0

Can it be foolish to quit a comfortable but deathly boring job?,"I used to have a job in which I hated my boss, and dreaded Sunday evenings. It was a toxic environment, and so unbearably stressful.

I have instead tried to fill my time with self improvement, but it still isn't a substitute for feeling challenged in my work or a sense of purpose.

Old company which is ""lean"" offered me a manager role. I've wanted this role for a while, but leadership is bad in that company and the role is very stressful. Should I leave a comfortable SME role that I'm currently in for 6 months to go back?


Hello,
I'm a mid-career professional with about 8 years of experience post graduate school. I worked in a MNC since I graduated - in a series of specialized roles requiring a specific skill set. 4 years into my tenure with that company, my manager moved on. I was expecting to be his replacement based on the conversations we had, but someone in leadership thought I wasn't leadership material and promoted my colleague instead.

I then took a lateral move to increase my skillset and quickly became in charge of product development for our biggest customer. I helped the company close a several hundred million dollar contract last year but I still didn't get a raise or a grade bump so I found a different role and left the company. I still maintained great relationships with my immediate managers and most of my coworkers.

I started with a new company early 2021 - this role is an individual contributor role where I've to use the skillsets from my first role in the previous company. The work is challenging but the pace is very slow and I sometimes think if I should have continued in the track I was going on and moved into management.

The manager of my first group in my previous company is leaving and I have been tapped to fill his role. This would be 3 levels above where I was 6 months ago and I'm hoping I can negotiate a huge pay raise from where I currently am (excluding bonus and stocks). I admire the line manager for that position and have been wanting to work with them since I graduated. I've also wanted the role for over 3 years now.

The downsides are the stress - I will be customer facing again and the organization works ""lean"" so there will be lots to do. Also the morale right now is not very great since the company is going through a multi-year reorganization. My current company is the other extreme, work is light and it's great for my mental health but I feel myself getting bored because I got used to having full days. People here think I contribute a lot when I work to about 1/3 of my potential.

Promotions in both roles are going to be after a few years for sure because they're pretty high up the org chart. The total compensation in my old company will definitely be higher (30% or so). Is there a reason I should make this decision based on emotions and go back? Or stick to logic and stay in a peaceful job?",jobs,1.0

How do you explain why you left your last job when you're returning to a role who is your old job's competitor?,"I worked for 4 years for a retail store where customer service was the main focus. Talking to customers about why this product is good over the other, how it may affect their life, which products would suit a problem for X

Truth be told I left because the job physically exhausted me when covid hit. We had a huge upsurge of people coming in to just browse, management was terrible and couldn't keep staff, the people I worked with complained non stop about management. Overall it was probably my coworkers that drove me mad the most, so I was feeling physically and mentally drained. I do consider myself to be more introverted but working with people was never an issue. I was a keyholder in the job and I would often be in control of staff etc and I liked doing it. I received a tonnnn of valuable training that would apply to the new job I'm looking at going for. 

For the last year I've been working alone at a kiosk in a shopping centre. You get customers approaching maybe every 20mins and the interaction is short as most people know what they want to purchase. My break is only half an hour (vs an hour unpaid in the old job). I thought I would enjoy the alone time but I'm going crazy. People keep asking me for directions to other stores etc. All of it drives me nuts.

I reapplied for my old job and then I realised I couldn't go back to working for the same company, same people. An opportunity came up for me to move into a management role there but I just hated the management and I didn't want to work with them in that role. 

So I saw a position open up. This store is a direct competitor for my old job. They compete for prices and customers. I enjoy the ethos of the new place a lot more and they don't just hire unskilled staff. I feel like I can bring so much of what I've learned from my old job into the new place.

If I get an interview, I obviously don't want to bring up management problems. And I also don't know how to convince them that I won't leave to explore other job paths, like I did last year.

Any help would be appreciated! I haven't applied yet, I'm still just thinking about it.",jobs,1.0
Advice about first job (please help).,"This post is going to be short for the sake of everyone’s time. If clarification is needed, please ask me anything you want and I’ll reply in the comments. 

Long story short, I’m a recent grad with my first job (9-5 office worker) out of school. Both my parents were teachers, so I don’t really know much about workloads outside of the education world, but I’m having trouble managing my workload. We sometimes work remotely, which means that a lot of our stuff is accessible on the cloud, which leads to a lot of work from home. What I’m struggling with right now is guilt. When I don’t get enough done during the day, I feel like I should be doing work after hours. I spent my first 8 months at the job almost always bringing work home. And I’m completely burned out now. I can’t help but think this *isn’t it*. I shouldn’t be having to bring work home right? I read about other peoples jobs on here, and a lot of people mention that they have jobs where they finish their work in like a couple of hours and browse Reddit the entire day. There’s just so much work and not enough time to do it. Am I a weakling for not being able to handle my workload and getting stressed out by the sheer amount of work?",jobs,1.0

Should I start a job I know I will be leaving in 4 weeks?,"So I've currently been offered a part-time job which pays well and suits me perfectly. Unfortunately I know that I will be moving away from where the job is located 4 weeks after I start.

I'm required to give a week's notice before I leave so really I'll only work for 3 weeks before I give me notice.

On the one hand 4 weeks pay and experience would be really great. I'd be sitting around doing nothing otherwise. But I also want to be able to work at this same job in the future if I move back and I'm worried that they might not be very keen to rehire me if I leave after such a short period in time.

I think that working the 4 weeks is the best thing for me to do but I also wanted to make sure that I'll be paid for my work as long as I give due notice. I'm aware I probably won't be able to get a reference as it's such a short amount of time to work.

How do I politely reject a job offer because I didn’t get good vibes from the hiring manager?,"To cut the long story short, I recently went for an interview with a hiring manager but off the bat did not get good vibes from her - she came across unenthusiastic, unapproachable and judgemental.

Below were some obvious red flags:

- “I didn’t have time to take a look at your CV, but I just took a look at it and it looks generic” (I have been through several job interviews but no one has ever said anything as rude as her)

- “I single handedly managed project XXX all on my own” (Failing to give credit to other team mates)

- I also found out she was either the same age as me or a year older and perhaps wanted to exert her authority as my prospective manager.

I really trust my gut feeling when it comes to these things because I’ve worked with some nasty and toxic people in the past and don’t want to go through the same experience again.

Started a new job after months of being unemployed and now I'm miserable.,"I was made redundant in February from a job I was just about becoming fairly good at(I was wfh at the time due to Covid). I took a few months  then started applying. The result is that I have started a position that is at least for now fully WFH with a significantly higher salary than my previous job. It all happened incredibly fast, I was interviewed on Thursday, accepted on Friday and was inducted on the Monday. The induction was fairly chaotic.

My colleagues seem nice enough (the ones I've spoke to over teams anyway). The systems could do with a fair bit of improvement and the drawings I've seen so far seem sub standard compared to my last place of work (reminds me of one of my previous jobs that I hated). I have also been immediately put onto a task with no clear direction.

Since starting I have felt absolutely miserable I feel constantly sick, I'm forcing myself to eat and I keep waking up multiple times during the night. It feels like hell. I have no motivation to do anything and just want to hide.

I dont know whether it's the fact that I haven't worked in a while and have had no time to adjust my schedule. Whether its the fact that starting a job wfh is really difficult or whether it's just generally giving me a bad feeling. Could be all 3. 

I really feel like I want to quit and continue with my job search somewhere else.

I have a dilemma guys. I want to be work behind the scenes on movie and then sets but I want to become a Tractor Trailer Driver (get my class a) as a safety net,"I’m based out of Philadelphia, PA. I’m 24. My current job I’ve been at is/was seasonal. I’ve been with this company for 3 seasons. They laid fine off the first season. I had to quit on them the second season because they tried to put me in the warehouse for $4 a less (the first year I was making $18 and the second year I started making $20, so when the season got lighter they put me in the warehouse for $16 and I went to work for a company in Kennett Square, PA delivering oil). After the oil delivering job I came back this year to $22 an hour. I have an oil delivery company that wants to offer me $25 an hour. It’s down the street from my house and they deliver in ALL types of weather and in tight areas like Center City. I have another job offer that pays $200/day|$1200 a week (after 3 successful months $1300/week and 9 months after the 3 months $1400/week. They deliver to far as hell places like Long Island, Brooklyn and Queens, NY but the most amount of deliveries (they deliver produce) they have is up to 7). And you work 6 days a week. I don’t know whether to stay with my current job, go with the oil company or the produce delivery company. The oil company is literally down the street from my house but during the interview the guy told me some shit about one of his guys going down a snow hill sideways and it scared the shit out of me. The produce delivery place has a daily rate of $200 and you work 6 days a week. I feel as though my current job is comfortable. But I found this place that trains you to get your Class A for $3000. And the program I want to get in that helps you get behind the scenes work on movie sets is like $6000. I have like $24k saved up. But I don’t want to spend money and go back under 20k.

I have 3 job opportunities 

Oil delivery down the street from me $25/hour
Produce delivery in Long Island, Queens, Brooklyn, NY $200/daily + 6 days a week

$22/hour (they want to keep me on) but the season is gonna start getting slow

Two paths with bad timing,"I got a decent paying job as an area manager at amazon. I have only been working here about 4.5 months. It is my first job since leaving the Air Force. Leaving the Air Force i felt i could go into a management position and i felt like i should shoot for such a position since i earned a bachelors in business management while i was in. However, now that some time has passed and I have been in a manager position at a warehouse i just don't feel satisfied. I have come to realize that i have wished i was working with cars for years now.

Being in a management position overseeing maintenance might be more for me, but i want to learn automotive maintenance because i do not want to work on planes again.

I feel like i cannot just switch due to having pay back bonuses and the fact that I am now getting married spring to early summer next year. If i had normal working hours i could spend more time with my fiance even if our days off dont align.  Our days off already dont align and the only day we get to really see each other is on sunday when she gets off of work and when i wake up since i work overnight.

My heart says make the switch now, my brain says to at least continue working at amazon until after we are married. I am at the point where i think about leaving amazon everyday and i have talked to family and friends and everyone agrees that i should make the switch.

So i guess im just seeking opinons of what others might do in this situation. The plan would be to go to school using my GI Bill to an automotive technical school. Id probably get a part time job while going to this school at some shop. With going to school and the va disability that i have i would be making 2800 a month tax free, then whatever i end up making at the shop would get added to what i make monthly. At amazon and with a va disability i am making 5200 a month. If i quit i would have to pay back probably 12k at least in bonuses.",jobs,1.0

How should I handle this job offer?,"I'm feeling conflicted about this job that a recruiter reached out to me for. The job is quality control for exporting plane parts from the U.S.A. to a government of another country. I have never done this kind of work before, but the recruiter said it was not an issue. 

My first issue is that I didn't realize, during the phone call, that the job is 9 hours day Monday through Friday. When doing research for the job, I saw that typically pay is 30,000 to 50,000. At first, I was okay with 45,000 for the salary, but now I feel as though I should have asked for more since it is 9 hours shifts. I am trying to make enough money to move to a better area or get my own apartment.

My second concern are the reviews that I read about it on Glassdoor. There were two, but they both left warnings: high turn over rate, being overly scrutinized, complaints about my work, and being both under valued and under appreciated.

I'm trying to get my foot in the door in an office environment. And exporting is something I am actually interested in doing. Both reviews recommend to take the job, get experience and move on.

I guess what I am asking is if 1) I should ask for more money since the hours are longer and 2) If going to the interview would be worth the effort. I know reviews can reflect only the negatives of the situation. So I am not sure if I should give it a shot or not.

The other job is much higher salary. Fintech startup. Good move career wise. However it’s a trip - 1.5 hour commute, mostly transit. Never know how people might be there. The commute will also end up costing me $250 per month with tolls.",jobs,1.0
Am I Making A Mistake?," 

I'll be honest, I don't have great grades, nor do I have admirable ECs so I've decided to hold off on going to college but I keep getting this feeling that I'm making a huge mistake. Basically I'm 17 and my plan is to get my salesperson and real estate license just after I turn 18. Two years after that I'll be getting my real estate brokers license and with those I'll be able to do remote work along with my other side hustles. After I accomplish all that, I'll be moving to a new country for the exchange rate, universal health care, and so I can speak my native language but ultimately just to save money and retire early. In my head this sounds like the optimal route to take but there's one big problem that I need advice with.

My mother is a real estate broker which is where my uneasiness comes from. Last year she earned $180,000 (roughly $110,000 more than average), remote work and reasonable benefits. If I pursue this career (which I am) according to her I can have the same success but her experience will be completely different than mine. She started working her current job around 2005 and her supervisors/principals decided to form their own financial corporation 2009. In the beginning things were pretty rocky but as of right now that same company is the biggest mortgage loan processor in the US, subsequently giving my mom access to the best mortgage loan agents in her field. I don't expect you to know much about loan processing but she's literally one in a million.

At the time, people with her profession didn't need to get licensed. You just took some college classes, pass the state exam, find a corporation and your hired. You can still take this route but everybody in my mother's position has a master's degree in finance from ivy league and t20s. Now that you kinda know what situation I'm in, hopefully you can help me with my dilemma. Do I follow the path that I'm on knowing that the future is uncertain or do I change course and go to a mediocre college because they're the only ones that'll accept me. Thank you for your time and have a good day. :)",jobs,1.0

Do you let your direct managers know when you’re interviewing for a new position? Or do you just do it and put in your notice after you get a solid offer?,"I ask because I’ve never given a manager heads up that I was applying for a new position but I’ve been told by two people close to me that they feel it’s respectful to do so for the manager and they always do. In the past, I’ve always just interviewed for a position and once I had a solid offer, I then talked to the manager as I gave my notice of separation. In my experience, people who give premature notice have been sometimes railroaded out of their jobs before they put in an official notice of separation or managers, if they don’t like the person and/or it’s inconvenient for them will do what they have to in order to prevent the person from leaving (ie. bad reference or abuse of their power to override a notice). I feel like since I’ve already gone through the motions, I shouldn’t say anything until I have something solid (official offer) before giving notice of a new job prospect and separation instead of possible separation.

What are your personal thoughts on this?",jobs,1.0

Transitioning to a new job,"I applied to a decent number of places when I was looking for work back in April - I eventually got a job that pays enough for me to live on, at least, probably around 1,000-1,500 a month doing shift work. The other day, however, I got a call back from an old place I applied at, back when work was slow and I wasn't sure they'd be giving me enough hours. They said they really, really liked my resume, so I came in for an interview and got the position.

Pay is 34K a year, with good benefits, a 75 day probationary period, and a strong union. However, I need to complete a reference check and fitness exam before I can start, and that can take around two weeks to complete. Until then, I am not comfortable quitting my job outright, and I'm not sure I would like to quit my position without knowing I'm stable in this one.

Amazing job offer but serious imposter syndrome?,"So here’s the thing, I know I interview well and while that sounds like a great thing, it’s now causing me stress. 

The issue: I currently work in a job that I feel like I’ve totally outgrown (I work in social media advertising, 6 years). A recruiter recently got in touch with me on LinkedIn and asked if I’d be interested in a new mid-senior level role, it’s worth $10k more than my current job. The role is with an amazing agency and incredible global clients. I went for it and have since had 3 rounds of interviews (the last one was with the President of the company). Apparently they all love me and think I’m a perfect fit, the owner went as far as to say my personality was “infectious”. The whole interview process was amazing and everything about the role excites me. 

So here’s the thing, I’ve always done very well in my career, but honestly think I just have a personality that people like and that’s why. I really, genuinely am concerned that I just interviewed too well and that I’m really not capable for this job. I am SO anxious about giving my notice in my safe current job because of this. What if I’m absolutely AWFUL and a complete fraud because I just interview too well and have a decent personality. 😟

I haven't received my formal job offer letter yet for a new job opportunity and my current company wants to convert me from sub-contractor to full time. I'm feeling very pressured/stressed and need insight.,"Hey guys! I'm having a lot of stress over a work situation so I wanted some advice from y'all as a non-biased opinion (since obviously my friends and family will lean towards me).

I have been a subcontractor on a 6-month perm to temp position at a pretty large company. It was a position I was super excited for but eventually grew to hate. I am not working from home during covid. And mainly because the job advertised to me was not the job I ended up doing. I was and still am miserable in the position. There is work on our team to do the things I want to be doing but we had a team member who took care of it all, despite me basically begging to be included.

When the 6-month mark came, my client falsely accused me of doing no work, despite me having proof and receipts that I was in-fact completing everything within the time-frame that was given to me. The company decided to stretch out my contract to an unknown period of time to make the client happy and did not defend me at all, despite telling me behind the scenes that they believed me. 

During this time, I decided to pursue new opportunities, as I was done waiting to be converted and I got an amazing job offer from a ""Big 4"" company. When I got the verbal confirmation that I was going to receive a job offer from the Big 4 company, that one person on our team who had all the work quit.

Now my current company is trying to convert me ASAP. I'm stressed because the ""Big 4"" company is literally my dream job and I still haven't gotten the offer letter in my email. The recruiter told me during the verbal confirmation call that it might take a while because they needed 3 SVPs to sign off on the hiring decision. This was on Thursday of last week. I tried reaching out to them via email, call, and text just to inform them about the pressure from my other offer/ask about the formal offer letter ETA and they just haven't replied to me. My current company has been pressuring me to start doing the paperwork for the conversion but I'm worried because I do not want to be roped into this job and accidentally sign something that will not allow me to pursue other opportunities. It's stressing me out so much, can y'all please give me your opinions on what I should do?",jobs,1.0

Trade jobs in canada,"Hi, Early 20s here,  finished high school with kinda crappy grades , never was interested to pay attention really.  I've always worked farming jobs( mostly equipment operating,and some hand labor work) Pretty much always made over minimum wage but being a farm worker has no benefits or overtime etc since it's exempt. Making $40-42k a year ish

Can skip to last 2-3 paragraphs to get to the real question 

I farmed a bit on my own (grains) but won't be able to anymore since I rented land and it's sold now. I wasn't very profitable anyway, made a bit but mostly did it cause I really enjoy agriculture.

I'm in Ontario Canada and housing is very expensive in my area so still live with parents. Now kinda realizing I wish I did do better in school and pursue college or something even just to have it in my back pocket for down the rd. 

I'm fairly handy with doing mechanical work and good with welding and was actually quite interested in welding as a career. But looked at a lot of welding jobs and unless you had years of experience the pay didn't seem all that much better considering I have a great boss and overall a good work atmosphere. Parents moving so wont have this job much longer as it's not worth renting a place here just too expensive. 

It might be the push I need to get into something better, as far as making more money.I still want to enjoy what I do and I don't really have aspirations in travelling the world or buying new cars so I don't mind living cheap but I'd like to be able to afford a house one day.

Interviewer told me to “expect to get yelled at and insulted” by our boss. Should I run?,"Hey gang,

I just had a job interview that ended rather strangely. The interview itself went very smoothly, and I was starting to get the impression that not only would I really like this job, but that I was making a great impression as well. 

Once the interviewer and I finished all the questions we had for each other, the interviewer read off a pre-written statement, beginning by saying that the boss of this small firm had a “volatile personality.” They elaborated by saying that I should “expect to get yelled at” by him, that he will “probably insult me,” expect me to know everything all the time, and work under unrealistically tight deadlines.

Should I run?

I handle being yelled at about no better or worse than the average person. I imagine that if the other aspects of the job are good enough, I’d still want to stay, but they’d have to be pretty fucking good.

To clarify, I am in my early twenties, and this would be my first full-time office job. Please tell me this isn’t normal for small offices. 😭

On the one hand, if these things were true (and they didn’t give me any reason to doubt them), then I’m thinking that it could be indicative of a healthy work environment if they’re willing to tell me this explicitly and upfront instead of waiting for me to figure it out on my own, which is what I would typically expect from a toxic work environment. 

I also considered that they could be making this up to test my resolve or something like that, but even if that were true, I don’t like the idea of working some place where my coworkers play mind games like this, to weed out the candidates who aren’t willing to tolerate abuse.

The job seems pretty great aside from that, and they totally would have suckered me in if they just hadn’t told me that and left me to find out on my own.",jobs,1.0

I try to apply to 2-3 jobs a day but haven't been getting anywhere. I get maybe one interview for every fifty apps. This last month or so I actually had an interview go really well (or so i thought) but then it ended up falling flat.

I worked with my boss today and it seems she has a different level of expectations of me this far in.

Well she got frustrated with me today, which in turn made me feel frustrated.

"Waiting on background check, did I mess up?","Hi all,

Recently got a job offer and accepted it. During the interview process the company was adamant about someone starting as early as possible, only problem for me is that I live on the other side of the country (USA) so need to move out there. 

The job offer is contingent on a background check, which is no problem. I've only ever received one speeding ticket in my life and that's it. But, now because I have to move out there so fast and haven't heard from them in a few days, I'm starting to get worried. 

I have to move across the country so quickly, so I've already started making moves to get out there but I haven't heard from them regarding my background check, nor have I heard from any background check company so now I'm thinking of every little thing that could possibly be a negative in my employment history (which consists of mainly part time jobs, a technical freelance gig now I do only for one company, an internship that was more ""volunteer"" and may not actually show up on my background check) 

I just don't know what to do and I'm nervous and freaking out about this even though I know reasonably I shouldn't be.",jobs,1.0
Given 24 hours to complete a HireVue interview,"Hi all. Yesterday which was a Monday, while at work I received an email from a retail store I applied to that requested I do one of those HireVue video interviews. The email got to me at 3:30pm and I didn't get home and settled until 7. I was exhausted from work and the last thing I wanted to do was dress professionally and use this thing I know nothing about on the spot. Today I had plans as well and couldn't set aside an hour + of my time. I've seen most people have a deadline of at least a few days to complete the video, but 24 hours? This really put me off. The store is offering walk in interviews so I plan to make time for that this week. If they bring it up I'll just tell them how it was during my work hours and I had no free time. How hard is it to call and set up a human interview? Am I crazy or is this short notice expectation really inconsiderate?",jobs,1.0
Is it normal to be used as a pawn in an entry level role?,"Unfortunately for me, I don’t do well with entry level roles and consequently, I can’t make it past entry level.

Why don’t I do them well? I’m not good with “just do what I say” attitudes. I’m not good at “looking” busy. I’m not good with being micromanaged (someone watching the cameras incessantly and where I’m required to sit in front of a camera so that managers *know* I’m working) and  being asked “how’s it going” every 5 minutes. I do not understand passive-aggressive communication. So if you don’t want me on my phone say “hey we don’t want you on the phone” DO NOT walk up to me and ask “hows it going?” Great. Leave me alone. DO NOT passively interrupt a conversation.

I hate how my coworkers are the people who decide whether I leave or stay. And lastly, I hate that decisions are constantly made for and about me without any form of inclusion. Need me to work at a different site?

Like is this entry level or all jobs? I’ve never had a job where I had the freedom to just do my work. I’ve had too many jobs where I have to legit sit and do nothing (or legit do the same exact work over because gotta look busy) because there’s legit no work to do.

[CA] Restaurant GM trying to pivot to HR,"TL;DR: I'm an experienced bartender/restaurant manager - I want to start working a traditional office job, particularly in HR. Can't get interviews/hired.

Hello r/jobs!

I'm a lifer in the restaurant industry who is getting out post-pandemic (the reasons are numerous, but bottom line is I'm not putting my life at risk for a job that considers me dispensable). I have almost a decade of management experience and a strong track record of long-term employment with no major gaps. I also have a bachelor's in what is essentially English/Communications.

I'm in my mid-30s and am trying to apply my skills to an in-house HR position - because I figure my hospitality, communication and multitasking skills would translate well to this field. I'm knowledgeable about computers and all major software apps, have a strong, workshopped resume, and am still having trouble getting my foot in the door.

Specifically, I'm looking to do coordination work: scheduling, onboarding, filing paperwork, rolling calls, following up - all tasks that I have years of experience in; it seems like most of these jobs are considered entry-level, with a few exceptions. I'm perfectly happy taking an entry-level position and express that in cover letters, but I'm wondering if my experience and age is preventing me from getting a serious look from hiring managers.

Lastly, because it's practically unused in the hospitality industry, I don't have a real presence on LinkedIn. I'm familiar with the site, I recently set my profile up, but my connections are few and far between, particularly with former supervisors, and on the whole it's pretty bare bones (I graduated college in '08 and don't even remember the names of former professors lol).

Has anyone successfully made this or a similar transition? Any advice on how to properly sell hospitality skills as interpersonal skills valued in a traditional office setting? Is there some glaring error I'm making that's preventing me from being interviewed, much less hired?

Thank you so much for reading if you did, I appreciate any and all advice.",jobs,1.0

"Just started a new job after not working for about a year, but I can already see trouble ahead. Not sure what to do.","Hey guys,

So I was laid off in August 2020 where I was working as a financial analyst at a major pharmaceutical company.

I just started a new Senior level role as a Private Equity accountant due to a friend who was leaving and got me the job at her former company. She told me the work is really a joke and it's not that important at all. Overall, the pay is higher than what I was making, but I am off to a really rocky start and I can sense trouble.

The company is majorly understaffed, no training, nobody on the team is reaching out to me to show me how things work, IT desk sucks, my RSA token wasn't working for me to log in for the first week I worked here and was just recently solved a day ago; on top of this all the 2 other Seniors are leaving in a month for maternity leave and I am supposed to own all their projects. My manager hasn't really explained anything to me since he is busy with Q end work, and overall I just feel like this is going to be a shit show and I barely started yet. The other analyst on the team has been working till midnight every night since she has only been at the company for a month, and I am supposed to own all this new work and have literally never done PE accounting in my life.

"Office Job: No pleasure in learning, no satisfaction but only depersonalization and amygdala costanly under stress? (Who feels this way?)","I worked as a fast food crew member in the years 2017/2019, then landed on a desk office job since 2020.

Although I have always had some generalized anxiety, since I have been doing this office job, it has increased a lot.... causing me to have agoraphobia and panic attacks.

There is also a non satisfaction in the work itself, because you stare at the computer, 9 to 5. I feel like there is no possibility of interest in curiosity and learning. 

Even if it's just talking to a customer or someone passing by, I preferred the days in the restaurant, even if exhausting.

"So many bootcamps and online training courses, how to choose?","So the market is flooded since the pandemic with so many bootcamps and online courses of different types and prices and job placement guarantees. I'm finding it hard to navigate it all. After looking at several and applying for a few, the first one I applied for was with Merit America, I wasn't excepted even though I was apparently an ""ideal"" candidate, in the end I wasn't ""passionate"" enough about exploring tech. That is fair since I had no idea what I wanted to do or not do. I was and am essentially looking to get my foot in the door and gain some experience to begin a new career path. I continued checking out similar programs and came across practicum by yandex. They have an option to try out a two week self learning course on coding for $50, at that price it was a no-brainer. After a week of learning code I knew this was not something I would want to do for a living, it wasn't because I can't do it but moreso because I just wouldn't want to sit and troubleshoot or write code all day. It was certainly worth $50 to learn some basic stuff and to find out that it isn't the path for me, sure I could do it but I would essentially want to pursue something else. After a ton of research and revamping my resume and work experience and talking with recruiters I decided pursuing a non-tech role in tech made more sense such as project management or QA. I have lots of management experience but moreso QA seems like a good fit for me personally and something I could be ""passionate"" about. So far I have since looked into School16 which is relatively new so there isn't a lot of reviews on it or information in general beyond their website but I like their approach. I have also spoken to a recruiter at Thinkful who seems to think I would be a good fit for two different programs they offer. In the end I'm looking for skills that make me marketable at least for an entry level position into a company I can perhaps build a career with. I know networking is a big part of getting an opportunity in the industry and these programs provide that along with some career coaching and interviewing skills. I'm just unsure how to choose the right course since I see value in them all but don't have money to do more than one and am likely looking at a deferment plan, no ISA's, both Thinkful and School16 offer deferment with payment plans after a job is acquired and they are not ISA. I would love to hear from anyone that has attended either or has valuable thoughts or experience they are willing to share!

Eight months and a few dozen applications later - landed my dream job!,"I have been applying for jobs since I finished school in the end of 2020. I did my BSc and MSc back-to-back in the natural resource management/environmental field and have been applying primarily for scientist, research, or consulting positions with the public and private sector. 

[I applied for 38 jobs during this time, got invited to five interviews and three assessments, and ultimately got three offers.](https://i.imgur.com/qQITUTo.jpg). The offer I signed is my dream job with a small environmental consulting company that works primarily with communities on conducting environmental assessments. 

Overall, reflecting on this process, some of my takeaways/lessons are:

-	I wish I had done a co-op undergrad and taken more time to gain work experience during my undergrad. I sped through my program in four year, and if I could do it again, I would have taken an extra year (or two) in a co-op program instead to gain the extra work experience. I think I got shut down by a lot of companies because of my limited industry experience (I mostly worked in research/academia)
-	Prepare and practice for interviews even if it feels awkward. I felt weird and embarrassed about practicing answers aloud by myself or asking my friends to do practice interviews with me. This led to me absolutely bombing one of my first interviews because of lack of preparation. The only thing more awkward then talking to yourself about what your greatest weaknesses and strengths are, is fumbling your way through an answer during an actual interview . After this, instead of just prepping the general points I wanted to touch on for a question, I prepared detailed answers for the most common interview questions, and practiced my timing and wording for them using the STAR method. Even just preparing for what you’ll say if you don’t know the answer to a question could make a meaningful difference during an interview. During my interview for one of the jobs I was offered, the senior staff actually praised me for how precise and effective my “tell me about yourself” elevator pitch was and said it was one of the best ones they’d ever heard. It’s cliche, but failing to prepare is preparing to fail. 
-	LinkedIn can be a useful tool. I had set up a LinkedIn during my undergrad because it seemed like everyone was doing it, but thought it was mostly just for recruiters and marketer to post their pseudo-philosophical inspiration posts and didn’t think I would get much use out of it with just a handful of connections. I ended up finding lots of positions on LinkedIn that I hadn’t come across through other search engines and when I was applying for positions I could see that employers were taking the time to  visit my profile. With a 1-2 page resume, you might need to cut and condense a lot, but with your LinkedIn profile, you are able to curate a much more comprehensive professional profile.",jobs,1.0

Did I flub this? What would you have done?,"So, I am a finalist for this great job opportunity in California. I'm coming in from out of state, which means it's great that I am even being considered. I have gotten to the part where the hiring person has asked for references. They wanted someone who was in a direct supervisory role for me as well as someone who I have worked closely with. I do not want my boss at my current job to know I am looking for new job opportunities for obvious reason, but I also have like several different people who supervise me because I work with several different departments. Due to that, I asked someone who has supervised me in some portion of roles, but they are not my boss and I feel comfortable having them give a reference without feeling like my job might be at stake should this new job not go through.

Like, this person has no jurisdiction to fire me, but she supervises me for some administrative role that requires me to answer to her. I figured it was a win/win. Plus, she said she would support me in my job search efforts, and she's a gossip buddy of mine. I went to her to ask for the reference, and I told her how they wanted someone who acted in a supervisory position for me. And, she agreed that she kinda acts in that role, and that she would vouch for me. After it was done, she told me she thought it went well and told me she was praying for me to get the job. Fast forward a week, and she's on vacation and I am doing her job as backup because her job is pretty crucial. I get a call from the ""Talent Acquisition"" person, and she tells me that during the referral, the woman I told her was a supervisor of mine described herself as my ""colleague/coworker"". And, now, I'm floored.

Now, it kinda makes it seem like I have lied when in actuality, she is one of my many many supervisors. I start to panic, but I explain to the woman that I have several supervisors, and that woman supervises me for certain operations. While she said she understood, I guess that alone was not satisfactory, so she asked me for a recent performance review. Only thing is, I haven't done a performance review since like 2019 due to COVID and organizational restructuring. I explain that, and she seems to understand, but...it's still not enough. At this point, I feel this opportunity slipping through my fingers, so I tell her I can possibly reach out to the Director or VP to see if they will give me a reference (these two DO have power to fire me). She said that sounds good, and I get off of the phone call defeated.

I'm in panic mode now because I don't want them to know I am looking for a new job, and if I do get a job offer from this company, I might not take it depending on the salary since California is EXPENSIVE. Due to that, I don't want them to know I am looking and possibly jeopardize my current job should things not work out. But, what choice do I have? So, even though I didn't want to, I started typing up an email to request a reference, but before I sent it, I reached out to a senior coworker of mine who I am close to. I explained the situation to her, and she recommended I reach out to an old boss of mine who relocated since apparently they had spoken about me and she had mentioned not only being willing to give me a reference but also looking for opportunities at her current job specifically for me. The person was my boss for the majority of my time here, so I figured it was worth the shot. I also had someone who was previously one of my supervisors until about a month ago when we reorganized AGAIN (she's kind of hard to get ahold of though). I reached out to both of them, and they both agreed to give me references.

So, I sent the HR person those two names, but I could not remember if she wanted a current direct supervisor (wouldn't that kind of be shady if she did?), so I made sure to let her know that while I do not want to provide my current supervisor as a reference in the moment due to the confidentiality of my job search, I am more than willing to provide my current direct supervisor should I receive a conditional offer. Which, I totally think my direct supervisor would give me a great reference, but I don't want her to know in case I don't get this job or decide I don't want it and then things become awkward.

Now, I am wondering was that the right move? I don't want it to seem like I have something to from the job I am looking to move to because I don't have anything to hide from them, but I feel like the turn of events and not providing that information may make it come off that way. Plus me saying this woman was my supervisor, and then she instead refers to herself as my ""colleague"".

I have formatted (and reformatted) my resume to pass ATS software. I have written and rewritten cover letters.

How do I ask for a 90 day review?,"For context, I was previously a paralegal at a large law firm, then became a stay at home parent for 8 years, so it’s been a long time since I’ve been in the job force.

My direct boss is the “do it all” lady - office manager/marketing director/listings coordinator/reception/everything in between, and her direct boss is the owner of the company. She and I are the only salaried workers, as all the agents are independent contractors. When I accepted the position, my offer letter stated that I would be eligible for a pay increase after 90 days.

"Lost a job opportunity I liked due to years of experience/salary before salary negotiations after being laid off from COVID-19 last year, should I email them back?","So, long story short, I've been unemployed for a little over a year now with good reasons (COVID-19, just had a daughter in December with my wife).  


I recently applied to a place where they were looking for a Sys Admin III and actually got an interview and try out and everything seems to went amazingly well.   


Until this morning, I woke up to an email that said I was a nice guy and I'd fit well into the team but wouldn't be able to get anywhere near the salary I was looking for so they couldn't offer me the position. Which sucks because I was entirely flexible about it, given that yes, my experience would dictate higher (was an IT Manager for a small company) but I was actually looking for a place I could enjoy versus making a lot of money. And their tryout session I thought I did well in (and apparently so did everyone else).

Left my job after a day and did not regret it,"So I've been looking for work in quite a while until I finally landed one. It was a hotel related one and on paper it seemed the perfect fit.  
Good salary, a hotel which is part of a major worldwide hotel chain, paid overtime, days off (rare in seasonal jobs but legal), plus I was going to live in the hotel (staff rooms) and eat as well. What's not to like?  


Well Red Flag no1: The recruiter on the phone told me that I would be working at the pool because they needed staff there. I was fine with it but as soon as I got there they told me that I'd be working at the main restaurant as a waiter.    


Red Flag no2: When I got there to sign the contract they told me that the hiring process is complete and I'll be signing it tomorrow before I begin but then they called me to get a uniform and head to the restaurant to work (!!!!).   


Red Flag no3: No training &amp; rude restaurant manager. I was literally thrown into the lions without anybody telling me what as needed of me to do and how to do it. Of course when I started working, the restaurant manager actually was rude to me because I was not fast enough (on my first day!) and told me right in my face that if I can't handle it, I should quit right here and now.  


Red Flag no4: No supervisor. Literally nobody was calling the shots. They has tremendous shortages and you had to do whatever was needed  like serve, clean up dishes from the table, polish silverware AT THE SAME TIME. My coworkers were deciding how to handle everything (who were literally just waiters with no experience -like me-) in the restaurant instead of a supervisor or manager.  


Red flag no5: No paid overtime! In my country the law states that any overtime must be paid on a +40% based on the hourly salary that you receive. But my coworkers told me that is not the case. One person worked 40h overtime in a month and they paid him just 32 and the money was less that what the law stated. When he asked why, they said that that's what the law states (the law in my country states that you are allowed to work up to 150h overtime per year and work no more than 12h in total daily).  


Red Flag no6: You worked overtime almost every day because they were short staffed but in reality a lot of people came, saw this mess and got the heck out of there. Plus you had to take notes on how many hours you worked overtime so they could pay you (sine like I said they paid less)  


Red Flag no7: No work schedule. I worked on the first day (what an idiot!) until midnight and my roommate woke me up in the morning to tell me that we'll be working together and that I should get dressed. Plus every one of my coworkers told me that their schedule is being sent to them on the night before. Meaning you don't know when you work until the last minute.

Should I resign in-person? Awkward schedule/new job conflict,"So I accepted a job offer, and now I have to tell my manager I'm quitting. I kinda just want to send an email, but every article I read says to do it in-person. I have a few problems though.

1. It's Part-time, and I sometimes work as little as one day a week.

3. I already have plans on the 13th, and I'll be out of town the rest of the weekend.

4. I already told the new job I'd be able to start the Monday after. 

So basically, if I told my manager during my next shift, it would basically amount to only a one week notice. If I sent an email today, I could at least get closer to two weeks. My manager has always been pretty flexible with my schedule (again, it's just PT), but I *do* want to stay professional and not quit a day after I tell them.

I have terrible phone anxiety, so I really don’t want to quit over the phone. Is emailing my resignation appropriate? Or do I need to suck it up and call her? If it matters, most all of our communication is via email.

Stuck in a tough situation - need advice,"Hello all,

I am in a bit of a tough situation with my career, and need some advice. I began my career with a company in December of 2019, and loved where I was / what I was doing. However, this past February 2021 I was offered a position with better pay and I took it. One of the big reasons I was hired onto this new position was because the manager thought I would be a great cultural fit for the specific part of the company I would be working in. I quickly realized this was far from the truth. The group I was working with was extremely hostile, and did not care to see me get better at my job. I dreaded going into the office everyday, and started to really regret leaving my first job.

Fast forward to a few weeks ago, my good friend tells me she knows of someone hiring for the same position I was currently in. I immediately jump on the opportunity and get into contact with her friend. On our initial phone call, he gives me an offer for a substantial amount more. I knew that this was a red flag, considering he had never even met me, but I accepted because I was so desperate to be out of the job I was in. I soon found this was a mistake. The company is tiny, no benefits, and has a very high turnover rate.

I am now stuck at this job, with a 6 month job on my resume. My last 3 jobs before the 6 month stint were for over a year, and I have plenty of good references. how do I go about getting a new, secure job? I am also still very young and decently fresh out of college. Will this help me? Any advice will be much appreciated.",jobs,1.0

I took five months off just to get my head clear and started to apply for roles again when covid hit.  I have now been nearly two years without a position and I just don't know how to answer this question.  

Can I say I left as a global restructure left me with no work (they wouldn't make me redundant until my boss retired which was several years away and he had stopped turning up to work)?  At the advice of HR in my exit interview, I did put in a grievance and a settlement was reached out of court.  Does this mean I could technically say I was made redundant?

And was pushed by my parents to start college when I knew I wasn't ready or knew who I was .

So because I wanted to choose something I thought I would enjoy, I thought about high school and how I really enjoyed art history classes and creativity/ history .

So I applied to the archeology program and art history programs at a university.

(got accepted but went to a different collage instead)

On top of that I thought maybe majoring in visual communication(was a big passion of mine at the time) at another college.

But because I didn't had the right portfolio to show at that collage (for visual communication) and missed the deadline to enter that major ( was at the army and the next deadline was only next year )

I decided to enter a different program at the same school for art a B.F.A in the hopes to change programs as the year progressed.

In the end, because I really enjoyed my first year at that program I decided to stay and thought I could be an independent painter/illustrator and sell my works to the public.

And also went to illustration studies on top of the art studies .

But when I graduated and started working as a freelance artist/illustrator/designer

I felt like I wasn't talented enough and wasn't fast enough for the clients .

In short, after graduating I felt very unfulfilled and from a motivated person who loved art and life and was very optimistic I became a very scared person without self esteem and lost in life.

At the moment I work as a digital marketer for the family's business and have been trying to figure myself out ….. for the past 3 years.

I’m very ashamed of myself and don't know what to do.

From what I know about myself so far I love being outside, I love solving technical problems involving computers or phones , I love being in an aesthetically pleasing environment, I love learning and reading , earning money by myself with my skills , and love being active physically.

I will greatly appreciate any advice and thank you for reading.",jobs,1.0

Is it a red flag if the interviewer blatantly ignores my desired interview time?,"Long story short, I am going through a recruiter to get a new job. I told the recruiter that basically anytime between 9am Pacific and 6pm Pacific works for me to interview with the company she's working with. 

She told me last week she got me an interview and it's at 9am pacific Tuesday - tomorrow. Perfect. She now just emailed me and it's at 6am Pacific (I'm in a different time zone which means this is an INCREDIBLY early interview). So early that I would interview, sleep a few hours then go into work. 

Was talking to my roommate and he mentioned that it's very disrespectful of the company to not only go outside my bounds but knowing what time zone I'm in to schedule what is essentially a ridiculously early interview. I'm considering scorched earth of emailing the interviewer to decline the interview and giving her a bit of business. Thoughts?",jobs,1.0

Is it ok to give my manager an ultimatum?,"Sorry for the long post but here we go.  So in my job our OS's (operation specialist) are supposed to help us with floor work when we're busy.  Lately that's been the constant because we're understaffed. I have one lovely OS, we'll call her N, that has no problem helping.  She's always on the floor doing whatever she can to get the job done.  The other OS, let's call her B, almost always refuses to come out of her office and if she does she complains the whole time.  She also has a bad habit of saying inappropriate things.  Examples being: when I was having an emotional time dealing with the loss of my grandfather she said to let her know if I needed her to take me to our closest mental health facility because she could probably make some money off of dropping me off there.  She told me to take the sexual harassment of a client as a compliment. She told another coworker that she couldn't leave even though her child was being taken to the hospital because ""she'll still be there when you get off. ""
The icing on the cake though is she called our DM and told him that since she's been here for 20 years she should have opening shifts from now on.  So they changed N's shifts to closings without even telling her.  N, of course, is furious. She's currently searching for a new job and she's got her 2 weeks notice saved on her computer.  I know if she leaves I'll never get any help at all when I need it and I'll be stuck picking up the slack of anything B doesn't want to do.

How can I request/receive the report of a Sterling Direct BG check?,"Hi all!

I'm busy wrapping up my recruitment process and will soon start a new job. My background check cleared, but not before I needed to iron out with HR one point of contention of a start date of employment which couldn't be confirmed by Sterling. While not a pressing issue, Sterling never reached out for me for any additional documentation or clarification, and I am interested to know what they listed in the report and what caused the discrepancy, so that I can avoid hassle in future if it's a mistake I made on my end.

From the docs, it's seems to me that candidates receive a copy of the report (Fair Credit Reporting Act and so on), however, I have not received one yet via their platform nor via email. The platform is Sterling Direct via the domain workforce \[dot\] sterlingdirect, and there in the reports section it merely reflects as ""Completed \[Date\]"", with no option to download or to view any results.

Do I have to request this myself via their customer support or consumer privacy departments? Or have I misunderstood and will not receive such a report unless triggered by some clause in the above mentioned act? Anyone with experience in this?

Hey guys, writing an update. I guess it's to kind of keep note of what's going on if I need to refer to anything if I decide to leave the job. 

Tomorrow I start. It was sold to me as a remote position and come in if I feel like it. But already this boss text me last week asking when I'm available to come into the office. ONCE AGAIN texting me during my time off when it could all be done after I start and via a professional email. We arranged a day for me to go in. He then text me saying 'By the way, I have some homework for you to do'. HOMEWORK, and I haven't even started working there yet? :/

Received yet another email this morning after ignoring his text messages asking me to answer questions about my hobbies? I'm just so put off at this point that I don't even want to start the job, it's starting to feel like a weird cult, extremely invasive.

The recruitment process needs to change!,"Have you ever found a job post that seemed like a job for you, and as you went through the application process you start to feel resentful because of the time you have to invest into the process? 

You have to jump through all these hoops to be considered for the job, while on the other end the employer has no obligation to give you the job or even respond to your application.

Have you ever been in this situation or anything similar to it? 

I think generally job seekers accept this as reality when it comes to looking for a job. 

But I also think the individual who is offered that same job, experiences the same feelings in the process as those who were rejected from the position. I don't believe being awarded the job compensates for that poor recruitment experience from the company.",jobs,1.0

"Verbal offer but no contract, still feel in purgatory. Starting my career, unsure what to make of all of this","

I have been back and forth at a big large media conglomerate company. First my old supervisor recommended me for a position I applied too. Here is the timeline.

6/15: screening talk with the recruiter at company. Basic questions.

6/17: phone chat with who would be my future boss. Talk goes well. Interview got delayed bc he was trying report on important news coverage (yes, job is in news). He tells me to take a writing test.

6/22: he sends me the writing test, i hand it back to him within three hours. He tells me that if “the news allows him” he will get back to me before Friday, then if not send a note. Friday comes, I send a note.

6/27: hear from the recruiter, i passed the writing test and i have two more sets of interviews with the rest of the team. Two back to back. They went well.

7/6: i follow up with recruiter because it has been silence. This was after holiday weekend so i knew it was hectic, she told me Monday she will have an answer. 

7/11: recruiter CALLS me &amp; tells me i did not get the first position but they like me so much to watch out for another position and posting. The “future boss man” was on vacation this week so she tells me communicating with the team has been chaotic.  I don’t take the thing as a L and think its good the recruiter likes me.

7/15: i get an email from one of the managing editors which interviewed me on 6/30 saying they wanna zoom to followup. She offers me a similar position with the team just different hours. Same pay. She tells me that she didn’t know the recruiter reached out to me to first tell me I didn’t get the job. Sorta red flag?

7/18: i accept the job Monday and email her telling her and she tells me its great, my future boss is now back from vacation and will help me with next steps.

Literally not a peep since and that was Monday. I was told they are hoping i can start beginning of August. I was going to send a followup email Monday just asking for a timeline. I presume they were busy with the olympics and such/playing catch up but this push and pull is getting ridiculous. I need a contract to sign already. I feel like nothings really changed.

When I first applied for this job it was M-F and 7 minutes from my house, pretty good deal for me. Well in January the company moved buildings (which was planned and I knew this it was fine) but that made my drive go from 7 mins to 28 mins. Around that same time my boss, the general manager for the company, approached me and offered me a promotion with a nice little pay raise compared to what I was making, with the stipulations being that I get my forklift certification and move my schedule to sat-wed to become the ""warehouse lead"". When they did this change, they made the rest of the warehouse crews schedule a stupid ""rotation schedule"" where they worked 4 days on and 2 days off so their weekly schedules were ever changing. This obviously pissed everyone off and of the 6 crew members 3 quit, and only me and 2 older guys who are lifers stayed. 

As you can imagine work became stressful and I decided to really step up and work hard hoping that when my year hit and I got my performance review I could ask for another decent raise. Of course they hired more people but literally everyone they've hired since have been crap workers and I have been the top performer in getting orders out for months, on too of my other responsibilities of running the weekend shift and running the forklift. 

There's a lot more detail that goes into this but this is already long and I'm not to the point yet. So my year is coming up and I woke up the other day all pissed off thinking about things and texted my boss and told him they were desperate cause they couldn't even replace the shitty people we have and that they'd pay me what I ask or I'm quitting. That was a terrible idea but it was an emotional decision and I don't think I should be punished or crucified for it. 

My boss who I sent the message to screenshotted it and send it to the general manager, who then called me into his office the other morning to have a conversation and long story short he basically told me that I don't deserve another raise and then I was acting entitled, which The message might have been but that's not the way I actually feel, I was just angry. I'm currently making 40K and was asking for 50k and another week of vacation.

My brother-in-law is working to become an MLO and said the company works for what almost certainly hire me. I have no sales experience, and I'm quite introverted, but I've always thought that maybe physical labor isn't for me and I should have an office job. The position is completely remote a huge change of pace for what I'm used to, but I think with the hard work that I'm used to putting in physically, this would be a nice change of pace and probably quite easy. 

I know this was a long post and if anybody takes the time to read it I appreciate it, and can take any advice I can get. Also if there's any more details of people would like to know just ask and I will answer them, thank you.",jobs,0.99
How do I tell my manager I need to quit,"This summer I have been doing a full-time internship but have also been working retail part-time for a place that I've been at for a couple years now to help pay for college. The company I intern for has offered to extend the internship through the end of the year where I would work part-time in addition to being a full-time student. With the start of the semester coming up in about a month, I've decided to quit the retail job and focus on school and the internship. However the retail job is my first job ever and I'm unsure on how to quit or even bring up the subject.

While I get along pretty well with my manager, I've never had to ask to talk one on one with her for anything serious. Do I need to hand in an actual letter stating my resignation? Or is it alright if I just tell my manager I am quiting, and if so, can I do it over the phone?",jobs,1.0
Relocating for work,"I'll start with some context. So, I actually really like my current job but the pay isn't great, so this week I started looking for another. I applied to some and within a half hour or so a recruiter for one of the jobs I applied to reached out to me and wants to schedule an interview with his client next week. Now, this job pays 65k at base, which is already well above my current job, but has the potential to go up to 80k DOE, which I'd be ecstatic with.

The issue is, this new places office is a little more than an hour from my current residence. I live in the LA area and one of my favorite perks is being close to my work, because I don't want to spend hours a day in traffic and commuting. What this inevitably means is I would have to relocate closer to this new position if I get it.


I know I'm jumping the gun here, but the job description perfectly matches what I've been doing the past 3 years, and I'm an excellent interviewee, so I'm very confident I may very well get the position after the likely interview next week. I guess I'm just nervous and thinking the worst like ""what if I let go shortly after relocating"" and things like that, so any advice or reassurance would be nice, especially from others who have been in a similar boat.


The recruiter reassured me that his client is still working remotely for a few more months, which would give me more time to plan things out before the move, but I guess I'm just feeling anxious and excited about this possible job/relocation. Am I overthinking things? I've never had to relocate for a job before.",jobs,1.0

"I had the job, but now it's delayed until further notice.","this is an emotional rant i need to get out or i'll explode. 

I'm honestly just really sad right now. i've had on and off temporary or seasonal jobs my entire career. whenever i get excited about something i have to catch myself because disappointment is never far behind. 

i just got a job, like a real job in what i like to do, as an IT support assistant at the library of my school. it was essential, it pays way more than minimum wage and offers an opportunity to become permanent. But i live in sydney, and as the lockdown tightens and the outbreak gets worse and worse. i received an email just a few days before my proposed start date letting me know that the start date is delayed until further notice due to covid-19. 

i am an international student, i've been struggling hard with keeping myself above water, and i've struggled with what jobs i can get being predatory cash in hand jobs. i've been slammed with covid from the moment i arrived in sydney in 2019. though i'm grateful for the privilege to stay in Australia during this terrible crisis, i can't help but feel a bit unwelcome. with my only lifeline being my single abusive parent back home, i feel trapped between a rock and a hard place. 

i hope this surge in cases ends soon, i'm terrified of an extended lockdown, i'm not sure how i'm going to make rent. i receive food bank boxes from my school, and i do what i can like building PCs for my friends, but the light is slowly dimming over me and i feel hopeless.

"Remote ""Any-time"" Jobs for someone that works on call (in Canada)","Does anyone work or know of a job that would allow someone to work remotely at anytime and when they are available? Seems too good to be true, but I thought it might be possible. Something like technical support that can log-on and take calls whenever, or picking up random data entry jobs? 

I'm in an odd position where I'm on call for 24 days then have 4 days off. I am paid a salary, but I end up with a quite a bit of spare time during the 24 days on. Considering I have to stay near my house during those days I'm looking for something to fill the time when I'm not called in. Unfortunately, I can be called in at any time (even nights) so I would not be able to commit to any type of schedule for the ""side gig"". 

I've thought of trying to find in person work as well, but I'd need to be able to leave at any time.

Quick rant: 

I don't feel too bad about doing this as my on-call employer misled me about the days off (I was told 3 weeks on, 1 week off - apparently my week is 4 days and their week is 8 :/ ) I was also not told it would be 24 hours on call, nor that the job involves working insane hours when jobs come up (I've done 16 hours straight).",jobs,1.0
Is it normal to not know the compensation even after interviewing?,So I’m a new college grad and recently had my second interview for a job.

Sadly, when I got home from my boyfriend's house on Monday, it turns out my grandma was very sick. I've taken every precaution to avoid getting sick. My grandma and I share a room, and my boyfriend lives an hour away, so I couldn't go back there to avoid getting sick. I had some symptoms, such as a slight runny nose yesterday. I wore my mask, sanitized a lot, and felt fine yesterday as my employer got me into the system. She told me to come in tomorrow (tonight now) at 8pm to be trained. It'll be a 6 hour shift, but I feel absolutely awful. I've been taking medicine and drinking a lot of water so I could maybe get back on my feet. I work in a restaurant, as a service assistant for graveyard shifts. I'm just worried about spreading any illness at all to my coworkers or people that come into my workplace. I'll mainly be cleaning, but it's still of course a worry, especially since the mask mandate is getting strict again, and I know any sort of sickness can be worrying. I'm sure it's just a cold, but I don't know if I should keep resting and try to go, or if I should call my boss and let her know of the circumstances. I feel so bad, because they are understaffed and want me to work asap. I'm annoyed with the timing of this illness, but I don't want to come off as an irresponsible employee.",jobs,1.0
How Are Employers Reacting To Remote Demands?,"With things looking to ""return to normal"" later this year I'm curious how employers are handling requests/demands to continue remote work.

I'm in financial services and last week word got out I was looking for another role because of this (partially true - I'm also looking to take a pay cut for less stress). The assistant manager had a chat with me in his office earlier in the week and tried to convince me to stop my search as we've already lost a couple of folks to permanent WFH roles.  Part of me feels like a spoiled child who had a toy taken away, but at the same time I live way out in the suburbs and save ~12 hours a week on commute/prep time. That's a large chunk of your life not wasted in the car! Not to mention being able to focus better not having to hear coworkers, saving money on food, and generally being much more at ease at home as an introvert. In any case, he said they weren't going to fire me, but I know they're starting to feel pinched as other coworkers are having similar conversations but corporate is still pushing the September office return. I feel bad for putting them in this position as everyone in the local office (managers included) are all great people, but I don't think corporate understands or cares about how big of a quality-of-life improvement WFH has been.

That's my story and I'm very curious to hear yours!",jobs,1.0
Start-Up/pre-IPO Employees: Any experience negotiating equity/restricted stock?,"I'm in the interview process at a couple of employers, and for the salary negotiation process (if I'm lucky), I'm thinking of replacing any annual performance bonuses with some restricted stock/equity agreements. It's a small company (&lt;100) but growing very rapidly, so a sale/IPO in the next 3-5 years would not surprise me.

I'm thinking of a structure similar to this: instead of a normal $XK performance bonus, I could get $XK worth of equity, based on the valuation of the most-recent funding round. Or half cash half equity, $XK singing bonus in equity w/ no year-end bonuses, etc.

Job Recommendation (Just an Idea),"Hey all! I wanted to put this in this community because it may help some people who are searching for jobs or wanting to know what’s out there. But I just graduated from a Top 20 School. I really did not want to work on Wall Street or any major company generally because I hate people with a robust ego and those places are usually what have them. I wanted to stay close to my family and just live a nice, slow life. 

Picking a job was difficult because I had so many options to choose from, however, I am 100% undeniably happy with my choice. I chose to work in the call center of a major growth company. Let me tell you, it is so enjoyable. I believe everyone should at least give the specific job a go. It teaches you so many things that college does not. 

In order to work in a call center, you must learn to quickly think on your feet, have creative problem solving skills, and you also get better at speaking/adequately relating your thoughts because you literally talk to people everyday. You have the occasional customers with attitudes, but most of the time, it is just regular people just trying to get a problem fixed. And plus, you meet so many people around the country that you would never ever talk to otherwise. 

Please feel free to disagree with me on working in a call center, but over the past couple of months, I’ve really come to love this job. Also, if you can find a company to where a call center is an entry level position, you can literally perform well and work your ass off in that position, and then work your way up through the company. These are just a couple of thoughts, but I just wanted to share my cool experience with my first job after college. Have a good one everyone!",jobs,1.0

There's no point asking them to turn it down because they'll turn it down for ten minutes and then turn it right back up again.

"""You'll never find a bettter job!""","Hi everyone,

Let me tell you guys a story about my shitty last job.

Before going I started my job, the company had a history of discrimination, sexual harassment , and fraud. I did not know about that until I consulted an attorney and she did a thorough research on the company and uncovered many cases filed against them. 

With that said, here was were some red flags during the beginning of my employment. 

A girl literally left on the spot on my first day.  

One of the supervisors were caught tampering with my collegue's work. He got caught and was forced to quit. This happened a month after I startec working there. 

A lot of the employees there were complaining about how they were being fucked with shitty benefits and subpar pay. 

The manager telling one of my coworkers that he will be fired if he continued with his low productivity. She literally said it right in front of the whole floor. 

Manager and the coworker will argue on the floor over trival things, such as tinder dates. 

My food constantly went missing in the lounge and the managers will laugh about it when I asked them where they went. 

Tons of gossip. Tons of favoritism. 

and lastly, I was called a dothead and I was ostracized by the whole company when i brought up the fact that it racist. (They claimed it was a just a joke and i was taking things way to serious). I even brought it up to my manager and she always said that she'll look into it. She did not do shit. 

Remember folks, this is literally the first 3 months of the job and shit like this was happening all the time, even though they promoted a family-friendly and highly professional workplace in the job postings!

10 months into my job and multiple rewards later, I get a glowing annual review and I get promoted. 

In my new job, I learn more about the ins and outs of the business. They put me in charge of the biggest server in the company and I was in charge of the big projects in the company. Now this is when shit  started getting juicy....

Since I was in charge of leading the project, I had to make sure everyone in my team knew the objective and their responsbilties. One  of the people in my team was John. John is known as the enforcer of the company and we all knew he is the bosses favorite. Rumor is that John is actually the father or uncle of my boss. He doesn't know what he is doing most of the time. OK...The project is going very smoothly. Everyone has their shit before the deadline. I ask everyone if their shit is good to go, and they say yes. We submit our project to uppermanagement and....everything went fine until they saw John's work. he did not do anyhting. I get my ass grilled by upper management.  This happens 2 to 3 more times, everytime I talk to my boss about it, she will tell me to 'help' John out with his work due to this old age... The dude is literally in his early 50s. 

John caught news about my complaints. Him and his cronies start harassing me at work everyday. Boss sees it and she turns a blind eye. 

I take work leave due to the stress at work. Compiled my evidence during leave and come back to confront John about his behaviors. I came back and the boss, me, and John patch things out. Things go smoothly... for a few weeks until I find out John and his cronies got access to my projects and start messing around with them. I report them to HR. HR doesnt do shit but they ended up blaming me for being a difficult employee. My boss is also on John's side. 

Afterwards, they started to tamper with my work even more, they started to call me names, they look into my social media accounts and gave away my personal infos, they limited my email and messaging privealges, they started messing with my time sheets... it was hell hole! 

But little did they know....... I was documentting their behaviors since they called me a dothhhead. It happened a year earlier. I had 400+ documents against them and everytime I report to their behaviors to my boss and HR, I would hold a reciept of our conversations and emails. I even kept the convos about why the harassmengt and discrimination wasn't being resolved...etc. 

They also did not know that I had department of labor and few attorneys involved in the case.... and they kept coming at me.....

I eventually had enough evidence for a strong case and I decided to put in my resignation letter. On my last day of work, John came up to me and told me ""You will never find a better job than this!"" Of course...

two months into my resignation...

Anyway, I have a good job, but it’s not great. I saw that an opening came up for what is for me basically a dream job. Close to home, great name and reputation, good pay. So I applied.

I got called in for an interview but they only gave me one day I could come in. I was working that day so I scrambled with my coworkers to get my shift covered so I could have off.

The first interview was great. I had a really nice click with everyone in the room. I gave them my transcripts and references. I have all the necessary experience and I’m over-educated for the position. 

They called me back a few days later and said “you got the job, you just have to do our company personality test.” Cake.

I took the test on good faith that it was legitimate and would give me a predictable score. It was a likert scale (1 to 5) and I didn’t give myself any 1s or 5s because I’m a pretty average personality I think.

Well I somehow ended up with 1s on a lot of the things that I’ve gotten good feedback on in the past. Things like friendliness and ability to work under pressure. I mean those are my strongest characteristics. Honestly, I suspect some kind of software bug.

They called me back for another interview and said they couldn’t hire me with these scores. I offered personal references and had a nice discussion with them about myself as a person and a worker and why the test surprised me. Again I had a good feeling about the people in general. We got along great. It seemed like they had had a hard time finding the right people as well. So even though they said they wouldn’t hire me, I kind of expected a call back.

Well…I got a call back and they asked me to go to the office of the place that makes the personality test. Apparently some kind of contractor. I would have to do another personality test and an interview. After that they would hire me.

I just…realized that this was not what I wanted to be doing with my time. It was a hard decision but sometimes you just need to set boundaries for your own sanity. And tbh it was just a big red flag. If they want to listen to some pseudoscience bull crap more than the flesh-and-blood applicant in front of them, it’s probably a bad sign.",jobs,1.0
What questions should I be asking in the white collar space to find the right work environment? And what are red flags?,"**Tl;dr:** I'm looking for any general great interview questions about work environment and stress levels, or company red flags. The below is just my personal story and desires if you care to read before replying.

I'm about to be 35 and just quit a job as an Associate Director at a top global marketing firm after a month. It was very quickly clear that they weren't fully transparent about the work, and the (outside) recruiter didn't do us much good in communicating my goals and abilities back to the team, or giving me clear answers about the job. They just wanted their paycheck, the business just wanted me in the door.

My parents always raised me that I should be begging for a job and an opportunity, and the company would do right by me, but I've learned it's naive. I've been trying to work on ""interviewing the company"" but haven't gotten to the right point yet.

What questions should I be asking to reach my goals? My ideal work environment must satisfy these items, and pay/benefits aren't as important to me:

* Work/Life Balance &amp; Flexibility - I need my hours basically capped at 40, ideally less if I can find a job where the concept is ""once the work is done, you can leave."" It wouldn't hurt to not have to log my hours or have to be sitting at a desk from 8-5.
* Vacation/Sick Time - I need at least 3 weeks of vacation, and the standard holidays. In a full time job, I would expect that to be paid.  If it's a part time/contract job, I would just need them to be reasonable in the amount of unpaid time off I can take. (Also, a HUGE bonus if it was a FT job that offered unpaid time off - I've never had that option in a full time job.)
* Office Space - I'd prefer 100% remote (maybe with occasional office visits for meetings), but I at least need my own workspace instead of some ""open office"" concept where everyone can look at my screen all day. At least a cubicle.
* Less Challenging Work - For the past 8 years or so, I haven't worked in a job where I've felt I could come in knowing what to expect, work through the process, and go home to shut down. I'm constantly handed work and pretty much expected to figure it out on my own without training or anyone else in the org to lean on. There's nothing worse than every successive project that lands on your plate being something that you have no idea how to work on.
* Volume of Work - I've been told by two separate bosses in my career, that didn't know each other, that ""there's always more work."" As in, once I finished something up, they'd find me something to do. Force me to do trainings/certifications, force me to come up with business innovation plans, once I even spent an afternoon dismantling shelving in a conference room. It wouldn't be rare for me to complete my projects by 4 PM, nearly the end of the day, and then have someone say ""oh, great, we still have an hour, here's another project we can squeeze in, it's due by start of business tomorrow"" that would require me to work until 8 PM instead of getting to leave at 4.

I think that's mostly it. I just need something more relaxing before I have a mental breakdown. Like I mentioned, pay is less important. I just want to be one of those people who can work 20 hours a week and then find themselves bored.",jobs,1.0
How to reach out to a competitor about a job?,"My wife and I are looking to relocate to another city, and over the past several months, I have been working fairly close with an employee of competitor on a project with my current company - this employee happens to live in the city we want to move to and has a lot of pull in their department.

Anyone ever feel guilty for leaving a job?,"I'm a car salesman; I've been doing this for 4 years and I absolutely love it. I started at a new dealership about 6 weeks ago, after leaving a super toxic work environment. I couldn't ask for a more pleasant place to work. It's been a dream come true. The money could be better, but the culture is a great fit.

Over the past 10 months, on the side, I started seriously exploring closing sales for online high-ticket coaches. Elevator pitch-wise, I close prospective clients over the phone for online coaches and business. I have invested in training, I've networked, and this past May, I landed my first client. In the month of July, working 10-15 hours a week for my client, I have matched my income from my full-time work at the dealership.

Over the past 5 days, I have gotten 2 additional offers to close for some really reptuable coaches. My income will quadruple if I decide to take these roles, but I have to quit my day job to accomodate it. This is literally a $150,000-$200,000 opportunity. I'm also having a baby in 2 months, both coaches are well aware of this and will allow me to wori from home with him for a few months.

I know this is a no-brainer, but I feel so guilty that I'm leaving a job so early in. They're having serious staffing issues, and I'm the #2 salesman on their leaderboard. Every time I think about giving them my notice, I feel kind of nauseous.",jobs,1.0

"What questions should I ask myself, if I want accept a job offer?","I'm tired of my current job (Games Localization). It's too many hours per week (40 + OT), for too little money (30k). On top of that, I grew weary of my work in an intellectual way. I'm just bored by the thousands of MMORPGs which are all the same anyway, by doing, reading and writing the same things over and over, by demanding clients that don't understand our work and the unnecessary tight deadlines and budgets that result from it. There are absolutely no interesting problems to solve, no projects that I could get passionate about. The fun parts of my job are more and more taken away from me and are replaced with cheaper automatization processes. It's like you want to become a chef because you love cooking, and then they tell you, your job will now be heating up instant ramen soups. I spent a good part of my day with administrative work and troubleshooting with company software, everything becomes more rigid and less flexible, because you have to work for the dumb machine, that can't think for itself. There is also a slight cynicism in the air in the entire company towards the management. Everyone can tell the bullshit from reality, then management pads themselves on the back for reaching the next sales goal, while at the same time, they won't let us hire more expensive Freelancers, although we desperately needed to. I'm so tired of this.

Recently a recruiter reached out to me and we had an interview. The job offer is in the same field (localization), that I'm working in now, but the team is much smaller and it's not about games. I would be taking care of organizing the localization of learning materials. I'm not super excited about it but it seems like good work. I would be working for 35k per year, plus they would let me work only 34 hours per week, so I would still have about the same money at the end of the month as I'm getting now with 40h. In this regard, the job seems like a good deal, although I'm realizing now, that I should have asked for more money. On the other hand, it seems that I'm actually overqualified. I have way more skills than they are asking for plus they were looking for someone with either BA or MA. I'm a MA. 

So since I'm quite fed up with my current job, I don't want to be hasty and just jump on the first chance I got. I could imagine doing this new job for a year or so and keep looking for something that offers me something I'm more passionate about. I also considered getting my Ph.D. in the future and having a more relaxed schedule might help to do the first steps (at my current job I don't even have the time to figure out, what interests me. I just want to numb myself in front of the PC or TV)

So what questions should I be asking myself to figure this out and avoid a hasty and bad decision? Maybe there is even some sort of checklist that I can go through?

"Supervisor promotion, don’t know if I should take it","Hey guys, a bit conflicted here. I got my very first job in May, and it’s at a popular drugstore.

Have you ever been passed over for a job because the interviewer seemed to dislike you?,"Hey, all.

Recently, I went through an initial screening and a round 1 interview that went extremely well. In the round 1 interviewer's words, I was a ""strong candidate."" I could tell that I established a great rapport with them. The round 2 interview, however, was a complete bust.

I reviewed information about the company and wrote detailed notes about their app. Hell, I actually started using the app before the initial screening, so I was becoming pretty knowledgeable about it! I was informed that we would be asked about the company values, what we thought about the app, and why we wanted the role. I was wearing professional but not overly formal attire (it was actually the same blouse I wore for the other interviews, so I know that my manner of dress likely wasn't an issue). I was definitely prepared.

From the beginning, this interviewer seemed cold compared to the other two. He started by asking me what I was told about the job, and I responded by saying that I was informed that this was a new department that didn't previously exist. After that, he started asking me about a previous industry I was in. He questioned why I didn't pursue that instead, and I responded that I decided to do it on the side and that I wanted to gain more technical skills and help people. I already had two years of experience in my current role, so it's not like I was new to the industry I was interviewing for. After that, he asked one or two more questions but didn't seem very interested in my answers.

After I asked him my carefully curated questions about how the company used feedback to improve themselves, what he enjoyed about his role, and if there was anything else he would recommend that I read up on or learn, he abruptly ended what was supposed to be a 45-minute interview after about 20 - 25 minutes with no explanation. I was getting bad vibes throughout the interview, but I began worrying after it was over. I tried to convince myself that I was just being paranoid, but the rejection email a couple of days later confirmed my fears.

I'm totally open to being wrong, and I hope I am so that I can blame myself and improve next time. I can absolutely accept someone being the better candidate or getting passed over due to not having as much experience as the company wants, but to lose out on a quality of life increase (presumably better health insurance and no more being on call all week!) and a massive income boost (a whopping 55% more than my current salary!) because some guy didn't like me really stings.

If I receive feedback about my interview, I'll edit this post with the details. In the meantime, I'd like to know if anyone else has any similar stories and if there's anything I can do to prevent this sort of situation in the future.",jobs,1.0

Question About Compensation,"Hello All-

First off than you for any advice you may be able to offer me, it is most appreciated.

A little background.  I currently work full time at a job that I have been at for 3 years.  I am the only person at my current job that does what I do, so that has offered me job security in these interesting and difficult times.  I get along with my boss very well.  I can pretty much come and go as I please as long as all of my projects get completed.  My commute is approximately 45 minutes each way, currently.  When things go back to normal, it will be 90 minutes each way.  Compensation wise I would say I am being underpaid by approximate $10k to $15k a year.  I have 2000 shares of stock that right now are 75% vested but under water by about $5 a share.

I have since been offered a job at a startup company.  Less than 10 people in the company.  I would assume the role as the Business Development Manager.  This role would include wearing many hats that I have not worn before.  Starting up Social Media, publishing content to the cloud.  Starting up partnerships.  Starting up a beta program, sales, demo's, running user meetups, etc.  The compensation is $20k more a year and I would work from home.  The question comes from the compensation side of the offer letter.  When I spoke to the CEO of the company I was told that I would get a 1% equity stake in the company.  But when I got the offer letter I was told that I would be getting 100,000 shares in the company, which the H.R. person said represented the 1% equity stake.

So my questions is, should I go back an negotiate this part of the letter? My reasoning is this. If the 100,000 shares of stock are the 1% equity, then that would mean that the float for the company is 10,000,000 shares. What if the float gets increased to 20,000,000 shares, then I only have .5% equity in the company and what is there is a reverse split say 4 for 1, then I only have .25% of the company.

So do I ask if the equity shares are static meaning it is a one time offer and that is it, or do I ask if they are dynamic and grow with the amount of shares offered?

Also, I was told that part of the strategy of the company is to sold in 3 years or so.  But my shares vest over 4 years, so what happens to 25% of my shares if we are sold before they vest?

Than you so much for any and all advice.  Enjoy your weekend and take care!

I feel so stuck in life!,"Wasn't sure whether this is an appropriate post for here but I hope so. Basically I'm a 30 year old who deals with pretty severe social anxiety. I've recently started medication and counselling (again) so I'm hoping that will help me get a bit more confidence when trying to seek a new career path. 8 years ago I graduated from University with a degree in English Literature. Since then I've been working a minimum wage job in a care home. It's not rewarding like I thought it would be but my mental health issues and a huge lack of confidence have stopped me pursuing anything else.

I've now and then looked at other jobs but I've not really put the effort in to the applications that I could have, because I just don't believe in myself. All I've got is some retail experience and 8 years of care experience. I'm not sure I want to pursue care work any more. A few people have told me that I have potential, I've got a degree so I shouldn't be in a minimum wage job in a care home but really it's all my mental health can handle. They know I'm socially awkward and quiet here, I'm scared of what new colleagues in a new job would make of me and I just don't believe in myself.

I feel like I've wasted the past 8 years of my life. I should have put more money into savings. I don't know what to do.

I had a ridiculous performance on an interview and was called to the next round anyway so I’m feeling suspicious,"Só a recruiter approached me on LinkedIn (which is fairly common) and said he came across my profile and had a job opportunity that he thought I might be a good fit. So he sent me the job posting and even though I found it really interesting I was honest and told him that it was a bit out of my league as I was just starting to develop some skills and use the tools that the job required. He said that the job was a junior position and as long as I were willing to learn those things fast he could refer me, so I said yes what the hell?
A few days later I had a first interview with the technical lead of the team. The guy started by talking a little about him and his background then I did the same. So he moved to a series of hypothetical questions that were supposed to assess my skills and know in which part of THE project I’d be more comfortable working with.
At first it felt weird that he didn’t demonstrate much interest asking on my professional or educational background. No specific questions in that regard.
Then the hypothetical questions were deep shit im theory and I didn’t have good answers for most of them. On one side I felt horrible for performing so bad but on the other I knew that was a bit out of my league anyway. The interview lasted a full torturing hour.
At the end, the guy said I would heard back from them in about two weeks because everyone was out on holidays and if I were to move forward then I would have another meeting with his boss but more on the company culture side.
A few hours later the recruiter reached out to me and said that they would like to book the next interview for Monday.
I was shocked knowing how bad I knew I did in the interview but I was still happy I get to move forward.
However afterwards I started to have my doubts about how “easy” it was, especially how quickly the response came. So I am wondering how solid could this be. I don’t know the company personally but everything around it seems legit.
I asked the guy why they were hiring and he said they had a guy before that left because he felt he was to junior for the position, so I don’t know if it’s like they threw under the bus or something like it.
I might as well be overthinking but the fact that I was invited to the next interview giving my poor performance on the first one does raise some doubts.

Should I switch my comfortable job into a challenging job that I’m not 100% sure I can handle?,"
I been working in retail for 7 years, and an opportunity has come up for me to become an account executive for another brand in my industry. 

All is great except it’s even more sales based and a B2B business instead of B2C. The biggest challenge of the job is I need to find new accounts, build relationships and sign contracts with them. I’ve never done an actual business deal like this, and I’m not 100% confident. I do want to learn and I like challenges, but I’m also scared. 

The last time I was in a role similar to this, the company I was at was upset I didn’t deliver better results within 6 months, and thought I was wasting time by constantly being in store. I ended up stepping down, this was 2 years ago. In the meantime I do see where I have gone wrong or what I could have improved, but this new job is even more challenging I assume. 

However, this role has been a dream of mine. I always wanted to be an account executive, and to continue working my way up. My family are dissuading me, “do you really think you can handle it?”, “you’re going to be too tired” (sidenote they not that supportive but their words get to me/ childhood trauma)

They think I should stick with the safe option of staying in retail as an assistant store manager, and not risk losing everything. Biggest risk is if I don’t do well in the role I will be fired, and it is mainly commission based. The salary slightly lower. And I’m scared but I also don’t want to lose an opportunity, but I’m also scared of failing and ending up jobless.

Looking for advice on job searching,So I'm trying to leave my current job where the environment has gotten more and more toxic the longer I've been there(going on 3 years). I've been searching for almost a month now and have applied to two different jobs so far that piqued my interest and both turned me down because of lack of experience. The only jobs I've had have been retail or factory and I want to get away from that and do something that pays more. But what do I do if no jobs will hire without experience and I can't afford to lose hours at my current job to go back to school? Especially knowing that going back to school could be a waste of money because I still wouldn't be guaranteed to get hired? Any advice would be appreciated and thank you ahead of time!,jobs,1.0
Question about background check,"I was recently offered the job of a lifetime (for me, anyway).

"Feeling guilty about leaving my understaffed job, any advice?","I thought I'd give some context first. I graduated college in May and I was able to secure a job that I thought I wanted at a small local news publication. They have a pretty small staff, it's made of three staff reporters, an editor, a 4 people in ads and sales and the publisher. However, I soon realized that the dream job was becoming a nightmare. 

I, along with the only other staff reporter were salaried for 40 hours a week, but usually we are expected to pick up more hours (which we're never compensated for). The position itself is set at just a little more than minimum wage for my state in the U.S. My publisher also expects us to be the ones to drag the paper kicking and screaming into the 21st century with a new digital first initiative she probably thought of last month. 

I kept my head down and was looking for other jobs. I finally found a place, it's an admin assistant position, but it pays way more than the paper with more steady hours. 

I'm going to put in my 2 weeks soon. I can't help but feel guilty about leaving them like this, but I have to do what's right for me as well. Any advice?",jobs,1.0

Is there anything I can do to hold my place of work accountable?,"I work for a dollar store in a small town Ohio.

I've been here over a year and things were fine up until the pandemic hit. Once it did things started going dow hill.

During the pandemic:
•Provided masks that did not meet required standards
•Did not enforce customer mask requirements to ""keep customers happy and prevent confrontation""
•Required employees to wash down baskets with bleach water but did not provide gloves to do so

Then after things lightened up, we had a store remodel and ever since the downhill trend got worse and faster:

• Got short staffed because of multitude of reason that 3 employees left
• Computers and pinpads being buggy and self checkout not work 
• Increased workload and threatened to be written up if everything is done fast enough and told tending to customers on a busy day is not an excuse to not have inventory stocking done despite beingshifts only consisting of 2 employees for ~6 hours
• Encouraged to not help each other despite being a team because everyone has their own jobs to do
• when things break down, they call us about it because they mo itor it, but take forever to send someone to fix it and there's no way to call them back
• Told to tell customers to ""suck it up"" when complaints come in about the shrunk cash register counters


Not to mention:
• when the building for the store was built, the inventory room was built so small that when we have a lot of back stock(because our system doesn't control what items we get on truck days, the warehouse just sends whatever so we'll get items(inclusing food) that we have no room for vecause we already have plenty to begin with) it fills up to where it can block the fire exit and they always put totes and rolltainers in front of the electrical boxes despite OSHA laws and company safety papers saying that shouldn't be happening(to which I've already reported once and friends told me I was stupid for doing so because ""you could lose your job if you're caught or they shut the business down"")

Is there anything I can do besides leaving my job to help fix the issues? I'm just a lowly cashier, but this just isn't ethically or morally right and I don't want to stand by and let my fellow coworkers and I keep getting trampled on my management.",jobs,1.0

Re-applying to a job that I was let go from?,"Tl;dr: Got fired 10 months ago for gross misconduct (shortcutting HIPAA documentation), want to try applying again. Stupid? Any chance it works? Anyone have any experience?

I worked a remote job for 18 months, April 2019 to October 2020. It was an incredible job, the culture, the coworkers, the benefits, PTO. I'm still so pissed at myself for getting myself let go. I was struggling at the time with some mental health issues, coupled with COVID shit, and having our first child. Because of that stuff going on, my work quality declined and I started taking shortcuts on HIPAA related documentation which was discovered and resulted in an immediate dismissal. They called it gross misconduct. It has now been 10ish months since my dismissal and I'm seeing that they recently opened the same position for hire. I was going to reapply online and just see what happens. Is this stupid, and merely an opportunity to embarrass myself? Is there any chance that they rehire me? And does anyone have any experience with a similar situation? How'd it turn out?",jobs,1.0
This job might literally kill me,"Good morning everyone!!

I'll keep this concise.

My current job requires me to work 84hrs/week for two weeks in a row, as well as an hour commute. It's 7 day shifts, then 7 night shifts, then 7 days off. I've been at this job for about 6 months. Due to the long hours plus the switching schedule I usually only get about 3 hours of sleep when I finally make it home. In the industry I'm working in this is considered standard, some even consider this easy as others are working 16 hour shifts for 14+ days in a row. I knew what I was getting into when I took this job, and I thought I could do it as I always try to be a hard worker, but this is absolutely draining my physical and mental health. The big issue is that I really only got this job because my father works for the company. The pay isn't great, but the overtime hours add up quickly and I am able to pay bills/save/treat myself sometimes. Am I being ridiculous to think about quitting? How do I go about telling my dad? Will it reflect poorly on him because his son quit after only 6 months?",jobs,1.0

Temp job is putting me in a role I didn't sign up for.,"I started a new job on Friday at a bank.  It's temporary, about three months,  and I got it through a temp agency.  I was told by the agency I'd be doing filing, answering phones, and directing customers where to go. 

The bank told me on Monday they would be setting me up with a bank tellers account and I'll be dealing with people's money (updating mortgages if I understood them correctly). I'm confused because they know have no experience in this and I was told by the agency I would not be dealing with numbers/money. I know it is a bank but I made sure it was strictly as admin role since it's in a corporate office (not in an actual bank). I am not comfortable with this. I would have never have taken the job if I knew this.

 I told this to my temp agency contact after work. She said she was never made aware of this, it didn't sound right, and to let her know how I wanted to proceed. I told her I'd decide after Monday. 

The cherry on top is that I was unemployed. If I quit this job I'm pretty sure my unemployment stops (even though I only worked a day so far). I'm such at a loss what to do? Im I in the wrong for wanted to quit?",jobs,1.0

I feel my pay rate isn’t worth it for what I have to deal with at work anymore?,"For some context: I have been working at this place for 5 years.  My pay has always been at or just above minimum wage.  I currently make under $12/hour but a bit above minimum in my state.  The customers and co workers when I started were pleasant - and management was organized and efficient.  Now it’s a whole different story.  The customers have become difficult to work with in some instances.  Some of my co workers have also become difficult to work with and management has begun to expect us to conform to new policies that affect our customers negatively all while we have to be the ones to break the news to them during a pandemic.  My pay has always been similar to other minimum wage jobs, but it seems now many places are paying $14+ in my area for those same jobs, leaving me making $3+ less per hour while dealing with similar, if not worse, conditions concerning management, co workers, and customers.  I don’t feel my pay isn’t worth it at all anymore for what I put up with.  I would just quit but I am in my last semester of college and having a difficult time finding a job in my field of study so I’m almost holding onto this job as a crutch so I at least have something after college, no matter how toxic it’s getting.  I just don’t know what to do because I know I need to let this job go before my schooling suffers but at the same time I don’t want to go unemployed once school is out of the way.  What would you do in my situation?  I am perfectly fine with not working these next few months to finish school, I just don’t want to go jobless once I’m finished because no one wants to hire me in my field of study.",jobs,1.0
How far is to far for a commute? (160km a day.),"Hey all, 

Pretty much have been job searching for a year now after graduating college. 

Found something, but it didn’t work out, wasn’t really in my field. 

Had a friend who offered me a position that is in my field and sounds like a great opportunity but the drive might be to far. 

The drive is 81km (50miles) from my house. 
This means it’s 162km (100miles) a day. 
810km (500miles) a week! 

The job I had previously was half this, and it was a pretty long drive. 
It took me about an hour to get to work, and an hour and a half to get home. 

My parents expect it to be an hour and a half to get to work. 
And could possibly be 2 hours to get home with rush hour in the city. 

I plan on next week driving out there to see how long the drive is. 

The job offers $45,000 start salary, day one benefits / pension plan and paid vacation. 

It’s an extremely well known company so I believe there’s options to move up in the company. 

Looking to get a second option. 

I personally think it’s a really good opportunity but I think the drive is going to be way to far.",jobs,1.0

Need advice for a admin position in healthcare,"I am currently working at a retirement home/skilled nursing facility (about total 70 residents) as their front desk for a year now. The current pay I have is $18.50 after one $0.50 raise coming from a three month evaluation (which was given to me three months late). Front desk is expected to do daily scheduling for the CNA staff here too (for some reason) and somehow, my role migrated from front desk to focusing more on staff scheduling (monthly/daily scheduling, attendance tracking, call-outs, etc). Mind you, I don’t have complete control of the staff scheduling as a portion of the task are still assigned to the Unit Coordinator or done by the nurse director. So not only do I have to manage all the front desk tasks, I also have to juggle scheduling for the nursing staff. Front desk is also asked to sit at the nurse station, I am not at my computer for at least 1/3 or more of my time as I am assisting residents.

Management recently approached me and offered me to take over everything staffing and payroll related as the Unit Coordinator is quitting to move out of state. It would basically be a new postion, Staff Coordinator. I was initially interested as it would make scheduling a lot more seemless for me to do, as much of the staff scheduling tasks was fragmented between the nurse director, the Unit Coordinator and myself. However, they still wanted me to continue working front desk tasks. I was fine with the tasks being assigned to me but I asked for at least $25/hr as I believed I would be “wearing two hats”.

Initially they offered $20.50. After I asked for $25, they returned and said $21/hr.

I found a similar job listing doing everything listed for staff coordinating but for multiple locations instead of one location AND no front desk tasks as I would be working from home. It had a pay range from $31-$39. (Yes, I did show them the listing)

Is $21 a reasonable pay for doing clincal staff coordinating AND front desk or am I  right to believe that I am being underpaid/under-offered?",jobs,1.0
Is my job hopping a red flag?,"I graduated in 2018 and immediately went to work. I worked as a paralegal for a year and 8 months. Was in lending at a bank for exactly a year.

So how underpaid am I really?,"I recently have received an job offer from a company. We did an interview, they asked me how much I wanted to earn per year. I felt super bold and added 5k to my current salary which is 30k.

They said ""Sure, no problem."" They didn't even hesitate or something. Now I'm wondering... How underpaid have I been for the last two years? Plus I'm overqualified for that new job. I have way more skills than they actually are asking for and I'm a MA instead of an BA. Now I feel I should have asked for way more money...

Of course I tried to figure out before what people in my job earn but since every company seems to use a different name for the position it's really hard to find reliable numbers. It's so untransparent.

I still think I will take this job, since I can work less hours for the same amount of money at my current company. I'm close to a burn out with my current employees and unhappy with the company for more than a year. So even if this new job might not be a a perfect fit it seems like a good chance to get a better job Life Balance and figure out what I really want to do next and move on from there in a year or two.",jobs,1.0

Should I quit my dream company/brand or stay a while longer?,"Sorry for any formatting issues, this is my first post.

Bit of a background, I'm a recent grad and my first job was as a client/sales advisor at a luxury jewelry brand. My coworkers were nice and pay was generous but I didn't really think of staying long term because I didn't like some parts of my job and I saw that one of my favorite luxury fashion brands (we'll call it Brand A) was opening its very first store in the country and I wanted to transfer there as a sales associate too.

Brand A started hiring late January 2021 so I applied, and after several interviews I finally got a job offer late March. But things started to get fishy, such as very late or no responses from HR. I think if I hadn't pestered them enough, they wouldn't have realized that I accepted the job offer. I ignored these red flags and didn't even ask for the commission scheme as I really wanted the position and I thought I would lose it if I didn't accept the offer on time. After a long back and forth, my expected starting date was already on late May (because I was still employed in my previous job).

I then get the news from management saying that the opening for Brand A was pushed back to August due to construction delays. Because of that, I'm assigned to temporarily work at their sister brand (we'll call it Brand B). I'm not exactly a fan of Brand B but I thought I could tolerate working there until August. Management gave me one uniform (which is actually for Brand C, another one of their sister brands??) that was too big. They said if it doesn't fit then I could buy a generic uniform (but they didn't say they would reimburse me). First day of work (or week) was completely different from my first job. Supervisor basically gave me a one minute tour of the store, taught me how to fold a shirt and then left me alone at the sales floor.  This continued for about a week where my supervisor would just stay in the back room 80% of the time and then 10% was for long ""bathroom breaks"" and the other 10%  she would come out if there was a sale to process it (associates are not allowed to use the cash register). I didn't even get a tour of the stock room, so I had no idea where to get stocks if a customer asks.

My coworkers and supervisors are generally nice people, but it was really hard to get definite answers from them whenever I asked about the company, because they themselves aren't sure either. Nobody knows the commission or incentives scheme (my mistake for not asking earlier). But one thing they do know is that pay outs are late and payslips are not automatically given. A coworker of mine hasn't gotten her $2000 bonus from exceeding sales targets. It was from last November 2020.

I also found out that because Brand A hasn't opened, sales associates who were supposed to be assigned there were also sent to Brand B temporarily. The company decided that it was still operating at a ""skeletal workforce"" due to covid-19 so they limited the number of SA's each day working at the store. That meant every one of us had almost 2 unpaid forced day offs a week. Original Brand B SA's basically got lower pays too because of this and I feel that they have some animosity towards Brand B SA's; I feel bad but there's nothing I can do about it? Another thing I found out was that there have been a string of resignations from the company recently. More are planning to, and I even saw a brand manager resign too. 

I have a lot more stories to share (like company asks for things last minute, doesn't inform staff of important events, lack of organization) but I worry my post might get too long, so now I wanna ask, should I stay and wait for Brand A to open? I really want to experience setting up a store for the first time and I know putting Brand A on my resume could give plus points, and potentially a stepping stone for better luxury brands. But seeing how the company and its people work, I could be setting up myself for more trouble if I don't quit now. Brand B sales aren't doing so well either and now we're being pressured for it--what I hate the most.",jobs,1.0
First job out of college. Did I make out or should I keep looking after a year or so?,"So I recently landed my first job out of college at a big corporate office for a local retail establishment doing web merchandising. Overall, the job is pretty great. I like the work that I am doing, I’m catching on pretty quick, and my coworkers are all very friendly. The only negative part is this. My job requires me to go into the office 2-3 days a week, because I have to physically check the samples before merchandising them online. For the rest of the e-commerce team, they do not have any need to physically be here, so with the exception of 2 other people on my team that will occasionally come in 1-2 days a week, I am usually alone in my office when I have to go in. There are other people working in the office but none of which are near me. In my sub-office within the building it’s usually just me and one other lady whose cubicle is on the opposite side of the office. It’s kind of nice having the freedom to basically do whatever I want, and work only a half day in office and do the rest from home, but at the same time it does feel a little lonely when I’m there, and I wish more of my coworkers would come into office so I could meet them face to face and potentially make work friends. 
My job is giving people the option of going back to office, and from the looks of it at least 90% of my team is probably going to stay fully remote. 
So, what do you guys think? Am I making a big deal over nothing and should be grateful for the opportunity I have given the perks I’ve listed? Or if after a year and I’m in the same situation, should I start seeking out other jobs with better in-person working conditions/friendlier company culture? Initially, making friends with my coworkers to some extent was somewhat important to me, so I’m not sure if this is worth leaving a good job over.",jobs,1.0

"Trying to get my HR career started, help me pick which job to take","A little background:

I got a my B.A. in History in early 2020 and then after some soul searching I decided History wasn't what I wanted to pursue career wise (lmao wish I would have figured that out sooner). I always had a little bit of interest in HR and so I decided to pursue a Human Resources Management Certificate in August 2020. I just recently finished all my courses and I'm awaiting graduation in September 2021. While I was studying I also managed to score an HR internship that was 4 months in duration that just ended last month. Outside of the single internship and the certificate I have no experience in the field. 

Since then I've been applying like crazy to try and get an entry level job in HR which has been incredibly difficult, so I also decided to also apply to admin assistant positions, which has been more successful. I'm in the very final stages of the interview process for 2 jobs that I think I've essentially managed to land and I really could use some advice on which way I should lean.

JOB 1: ""Recruitment Officer""

\- Temporary position (4 months)

\- Told there is a possibility for permanent hire if I excel but no promises

\- Paid 1/3 more than job 2

\- Cash bonus at the end of the 4 months

\- Truly an HR role that I think I could learn a lot in

\- Takes 1 hour to get to the office

&amp;#x200B;

JOB 2: ""Administrative Assistant""

\- Permanent position, full benefits

\- Pay is 2/3 of job 1, no cash bonus

\- Not HR related

\- Takes 25 minutes to get to the office

&amp;#x200B;

I'm leaning towards job 1 as there's a far more direct connection to Human Resources. I've been told that an administrative assistant position could still lead towards a career in HR but obviously it's less direct. I'm just worried that if I don't get hired permanently at the end of job 1, then the 4 months would spend there  is simply not enough to make me more attractive to recruiters for HR positions when I start the job hunt again.

Any thoughts, advice, or tips on the situation would be greatly appreciated.

TL;DR: Trying to get HR career started. Likely can land 2 jobs. Job 1 is HR related but is temporary. Job 2 isn't directly HR related but is permanent with benefits. Help me decide.",jobs,1.0
How to follow up on one transfer opportunity without ruining another potential one within my company?,"I'm extremely torn about a couple potential opportunities for transferring to one of two cities within my company and how to go about it professionally without screwing myself out of both opportunities. Apologies up front for the long winded post but I would really appreciate any feedback on how to handle this.

This location is very preferable to us because the cost of living is comparable to where we are now and I have family including my brother who lives there now. Even though I initially didn't get the position and was told they chose someone else, something has happened because the job was reposted last week which was confirmed by the HR manager/talent recruiter that I dealt with for the job posting. I have not received any information though as to whether they are looking to come back to me for an offer but it's been only a week and my company tends to move very slow if it's not a dire need to fill the position. The HR manager only told me that they would hope to have an update soon when I inquired if I should apply again to the reposting of the job. 

I now also have a very likely chance of receiving an offer for a different role in another city that is intriguing to us. However the cost of living will be a decent amount higher in this other location. I would likely accept with the right compensation adjustment and I expect to recieve an offer for this position within the next week or two given the discussions in the interviews I've had. 

My big dilemma is how I can professionally inquire whether I am in any consideration for the original job in Atlanta so as to not ruin my chances of getting the offer in the other city. This is concerning to me because it's the same HR/Talent recruiter managing both job postings for my company. I'm afraid if I ask about the Atlanta job again, it might raise a flag that I'm not as dedicated to the other position where I'm expecting to receive an offer relatively soon.

Given that I haven't heard from the manager in the Atlanta area that I initially interviewed with nor the HR manager about that position once their initial hire fell through, I'm skeptical that I am really in serious consideration but I don't want to assume that before it's for sure a done deal. Is there any appropriate way to inquire one last time about it before I potentially end up receiving an offer in the other location?",jobs,1.0
Is it a red flag if all of the interview questions are easy?,"Question is the topic: is it noteworthy if all of the questions I was asked during an interview were easy, softball question?

Applying for job and reference request - advice needed,"I am wondering if you can give me some perspective on this issue since I have tried several times to contact the HR department for this job without success. I am applying for an administrative job at a university that required that i write the name and email address for 3 references. Okay no problem - I contacted my references and let them know i'm applying for jobs. The issue is they write the following 

&gt; Once you successfully complete and submit you will receive a confirmation number. *Your reference letter writers will be contacted directly by email and will be provided with information to submit their letters.* 

Isn't it weird for a place to contact references at the point of application? I would feel more comfortable that they contact them if I was at least contacted for an interview and better yet if I was a finalist. It mentioned that they use the Interfolio system, which I am familiar with due to my friends on the academic job market (TT jobs). This is an executive administrative position so I don't know why they would make my references go through all these hoops at the point of application. I want to respect my references' time and asking for them to submit formal letters right now I think is a bit outrageous. 

Is this normal? It actually is making me think the better of applying to the position. That might be dramatic, but I don't know - I just think this is weird.",jobs,1.0

How to navigate a difficult 3 day assessment while working?,"I requested 3 days of annual leave with my company because I'm attending a virtual assessment by an international MNC which will last 3 days (they hinted even the middle of the night will not be safe as they have international participants). My request was rejected because I'm dealing with a collaboration project with another company, and the deadline for this project is going to be close. The day of the assessment also cannot be moved unless by a very ""solid reason"" as this is the only time they've been allowed. 

The pay jump from my current ""fresh grad"" salary to this MNC company is a 50% pay increase, which will mean I'll finally be able to move out of my toxic home environment.   
This assessment is crucial for me, and the only way to get into this program, because out of 50 participants, only 15 or less will get selected. I've gone through 3 assessments earlier and they were tough, and required full attention due to time constraints and constant discussion among team members (I hardly even went to the bathroom due to how difficult it was). 

My boss did tell me she will allocate me ""some time off"" to deal with certain things related to my leave request, but **how do I navigate a very tough assessment period while having to work?**  
This assessment is the closest thing I've got to getting a new job with finally decent pay and to say including this MNC in my resume would help boost my future career, is an understatement.

A suggestion was to get medical leave during these 3 days, but my current doesn't have health benefits, so I'd be paying out of pocket. And I've mostly drained my bank account due to prior health issues already. Also to go on medical leave on the 3 days I've applied and got rejected for leave is pretty obviously suspicious...

 I am freaking out at how to deal with this, and the immense pressure is getting to me that I'm beginning to shut down and wanting to pull out of this completely.",jobs,1.0

Merit for a raise?,"Hi there, 

Looking for some outside opinions. I have been with my current company for 1.5 years. I started when covid first hit - my employer kept me around while others were laid off - I am very thankful for that (I also took a 20% pay cut). I was hired by them through a third party recruiter - the recruiter told me I couldn't negotiate pay or anything with the employer directly and that the recruiter was handling that. At the start of my role I was doing reception, administrative duties and AR and AP. FFW to now I am still doing all of those roles plus HR, payroll, bank reconciliations sourcing out new printers and getting a better budgeted price, looking into entry software so we can take out a lot of our manual process, spearheading the HRIM system and  payroll time tracking system so we have less errors (we currently use an excel spreadsheet for 54 employees on our wage side -  I also do payroll for 35 people on our salary side)and in depth AR analysis with weekly emails to suppliers that have not paid. Few things to note - my salary went from 50k to 55k in January as a pay increase (I took on payroll and HR after this raise). 

My employer is paying for my HR cert - with a government grant (Alberta, Canada) -  (keep in mind HR is a missing role within the company and I volunteered to become a HR professional for them - which honestly is giving me guidance in a new career). I've been doing some research in my city and I see that I am underpaid for all I am doing - I also only get two weeks of vacation while all the rest of the employees but 2 other people in my company get 3 -4 weeks vacation. 

My question is am I being greedy asking for an increase and for another week of vacation?
 I will put together a business case and showcase my points but I am just wondering if you guys think I am out of left field and that it's not warranted to ask for this since they did give me an increase and are paying for my education.

I would prefer to opt-out of arbitration because I feel like I gain nothing from it and lose some rights. However, I am quite afraid that I may face repercussions from doing so.

Job B is a contract job for 12 months. With a downgraded pay of $17-18/hr. But it is a bus ride away of 15-20 minutes.

Benefits, although not competitive, do not matter to me at this time. I am 22 and still on my parents’ insurance. HR only gave me a 3 day timeline to answer yes or no, which concerns me. HR will not negotiate my pay any further stating I “should be happy as the $1.25 raise plus the health insurance benefits add up to 10% more than my current pay.”

I hate how they used my current pay to formulate a proposed rate. IMO, my past pay should NOT matter. It should be based off the duties. It just doesn’t rub me the right way. 

Coworkers from the departments upstairs keep giving me mixed opinions/advice. However, all of them agree the pay is too low for the tasks given (opening accounts, auditing tellers, opening loans, ETC). The pro that is stumping me is the possibility to advance further with this position. Also, declining it now may effect my future pursuit to advance. Plus this would look good on a resume.

Would you take it and why? Any advice is greatly appreciated! I’m just so lost..",jobs,1.0
"Interview with HR - I love the job, but it might be too junior for me. Should I ask HR for a more senior position/title?","I have an interview with HR next week for a position that I'm really, really excited about!

Plus, I have a connection at the company who referred me to get into the door. He said that my experience matches the role very well, but he is concerned that the position might actually be too junior for me. While this opening is by no means entry level, I do have 5 years of work experience and 1 year of people leadership. This role, however, calls for only 1-3 years of experience and has no managerial component. He suggested I ask HR during my interview if there might be more senior positions available, or if this position could be made more senior in both title and responsibilities, as he mentioned that a senior version of this position would put me into a significantly higher pay bracket. Given my qualifications, I believe I am well suited to handle a senior role.

My problem is that I don't know how to phrase this ask to HR. I'm scared that I'll come off as ungrateful for the opportunity, or that I might jeopardize my candidacy if there are other applicants out there who aren't going to raise this concern. How should I appraoch this? Is there a way I can phrase it so that I demonstrate that I want this position, but given my experience I believe I could take on additional responsibility at a more senior title?

"Manager is having fellow peer colleague decide who gets the new position, conflict of interest?"," 

Hello - Would really appreciate the crappy situation my gf has been dealing with at work that has dragged on all year.

GF is a radiation therapist that has worked as a casual (you get offered shifts when needed, no benefits) at her current hospital for over 1 year now. Last November, a colleague in a .8 position (4 scheduled shifts a week + benefits) was moving states and my gf was verbally offered the position once the move takes place. My gf accepted right away, however, the move took months longer than expected and due to the pandemic, once the colleague moved away her hospital was in a hiring freeze so she did not get the offer at that point.

Since last November she's been working full time every week with no benefits. Despite it being illegal, HR has not followed up on it and it's better for everyone involved that my gf gets full time hours without benefits vs just cut down hours so the hospital doesn't get benefits. She's one of the best therapists there and has only gotten praise from colleagues and patients. Also the only therapist that speaks Spanish which is great since it's a downtown hospital with a large variety of Spanish speaking patients. So that's how her position has been the last year and she has consistently asked her manager about the status of the .8 Therapist position since they so clearly needed to hire someone yet months and months went by with no answers from the manager other than 'HR hasn't given me any new info'

As of 6/21, the job position for the .8 position was posted online and my gf found it 2 days later. Confronted her manager who said 'oh yes i was going to speak to you about it today and say you should apply. We need to go through the official hiring process'. That seemed fair but since then it's been a whole lot of BS despite my gf applying that night with a refreshed resume and cover letter.

Today, when asking her manager for the status of the job she was told her manager is going to leave it to the two full-time therapists, John and Katie, to decide who is hired since they did receive an applicant. My gf spoke with John who she is very close with and he confirmed he has had no discussion about having any say in who is hired and just as they both suspected, all say is with the other therapist Katie to decide who is hired.

Some info about Katie who is the therapist who has worked there the longest:  
\-She has openly said in the past how she does not like other women and she cannot work well with other women.  
\-When they attempted to hire another casual therapist, Katie was given all say on who is chosen and she shot down the 2 female applicants and only wanted the male applicant. He accepted but later retracted since he got a better offer elsewhere.  
\-Katie is also well known to be unhappy with her marriage and has had an ongoing confirmed affair with a fellow colleague in the hospital.

As of this last week, a male applicant applied for the position and was given an interview. As it currently stands, it appears Katie gets 100% say in who is hired and the position will likely be given to this new guy.

A couple side points:  
\-Even though my gf has 1 year as a therapist here, the current therapist John was hired on full time with less than 1 year of experience one year ago.  
\-In radiation therapy, the standard expectation is that casuals get first dibs on .8 and other full time positions vs hiring from outside someone that's brand new. Having someone that knows the machinery and equipment is a huge plus. My gf is the ideal candidate considering she's got nothing but great feedback from doctors, patients, and everyone else in the clinic.  
\-Her manager is the most incapable manager i've ever heard about and is someone who cannot handle any confrontation in any manner. I 100% am not surprised she's too scared to decide who to hire and is passing it off to Katie to choose who is hired instead of herself due to potential backlash from Katie.

So we would really appreciate feedback on this situation and any suggested guidance:  
\-Is it a conflict of interest for a therapist to get the total say in who gets hired instead of the manager? Seems so wrong for the manager to be passing off all input to the therapists vs making the decision herself and so far she has only wanted the input from Katie and not even asked John for his suggested choice.  
\-We know Katie does not want this position to go to a female and despite getting along well with my gf likely doesn't care enough vs the chance to have it go to some new guy instead.  
\-How can my gf confront this situation with her manager? is she just stuck out of luck by having such a crumby manager? She really wants to call out the fact that she has not been treated fairly in this hiring process considering she was verbally offered the position in November and now isn't even being given an interview yet despite being told she's a serious candidate.

I get along well with my boss and colleagues, and I feel like I'm much better in my role than when I first started. Recently he's been showing me how to do complex designs (engineering intern btw).

Looking for advice on asking questions after interview + before decision,"I had an interview for an assembly role at a small (&lt;30 employees) place a couple days ago. My interview was with the ceo, who was a very soft spoken engineering guy who spent most of the time explaining what the work was like. It ended on basically both of us saying we’d take about a week to think about things (or on his end talk to people about it and whatever), and he said to contact him with any further questions. I don’t have experience specific to this type of work and they’d be training me. Their main concern definitely seemed to be whether I was sure I could see myself doing this kind of work/being at the company long term.

So my questions are 

1. If I’ve decided that I would be interested in taking the position (depending on pay/benefits) sooner than a week, should I tell them that? Or does that come off presumptuous and I’m supposed to wait until they decide and get back to me?

2. When should I be asking what questions? These are all the things I can think of that I’d want to know before accepting a job there, and when I’m assuming I’m supposed to ask if I have any idea:

-salary/benefits: assuming they tell me when they offer the job, if they do. 

-more specifics on overtime. He mentioned there’s an expectation to stay a little when they get busy and then people can leave early when things are slow, but I’d want to be clearer on how often/how much overtime is typical: honestly don’t know when I’d ask this 

-if I’m allowed to have earbuds in while working once I’m through initial training. Idk if that doesn’t seem that important but it’s very tedious solitary work so that’d be vital: Don’t know when I’d ask

-if people would be assigned to training me for the day/part of the day, or if I’d be trying to find people who have some spare time to show me stuff, or something else: thinking I could ask this now along with stating interest (if I should be doing that at this point)

-how the company handle things like dangerous driving conditions and last minute personal emergencies. Like if things around the job location are fine but there’s a blizzard with 0% visibility where someone is commuting from: thinking I could ask now

My instincts if I had to decide without input would be to send an e-mail early-ish Friday thanking them for taking the time to interview me, stating interest and saying I just had a couple questions, asking about training, overtime, emergencies, and music, and to let me know if they have any further questions for me.

The email said they had seen my art station page and wanted to email me to apply for the job. So I figured if that wasn't a scam, they would see that the art station page is the same and still reach out for an interview if interested.

I'm honestly so beyond sick of not being able to trust any of them and having to immediately assume it's a scam unless given any reason to believe otherwise and then I'd still be unsure until I practically got the job and started working or spoke with a hiring manager or something.

Luckily I have a part time job at the moment that pays pretty well, but it's not at all what I'm hoping to do, so I still want to look for something that would be along the lines of what I'm looking for.

Temp Job Malaise,"I'm a little more than a month into a long-term temp position with a possibility of it becoming permanent.  As soon as the position began my site supervisor made me question my decision to take the job.  While the work isn't quite what I'm looking to do long-term (was looking to land an accounting clerk or related role), it suffices.  I'm working with another temp who started almost a couple months before I did.  We both replaced regular employees who left in part because of her.  I'm still not fully trained yet, and I shudder to think what will happen once I am, as she gets on the other temp's case all the time.  She's a textbook micromanager, is passive aggressive, and is exactly the type of person who triggers my anxiety.  I try to avoid interacting with her as much as possible, especially if she's in a bad mood.  This place has a six month probation period, which is why I think we're there.  This company can put us through this probation period at the expense of the staffing agency in case things don't work out.  IF I make it to the six months, and am offered the position, it's highly unlikely at this point I'll take it.  Needless to say, I've returned to sending out resumes.

My question is, the agency hasn't followed up with me since I started.  I've been considering reaching out to my staffing manager, and being honest with him and state that I can't see myself in the role permanently.  On one hand, I figure it's better to keep it all to myself, see how things play out, and hope I land something else. I also don't want to come off as a complainer on my first assignment (I had used this agency before, but that was nearly 15 years ago). On the other, I'm not sure how it would look in the agency's view if I worked this job for six months, was offered it permanently, and told them no.

25 years old and feel totally stuck. I'm tired of restaurant and retail work. What are my options?,[removed],jobs,1.0
are these red flags? (nonprofit work),"i started working for a non-profit back in february and was onboarded remotely - and am expected to move down for in-person work starting september. i am a very anxious individual, and sometimes anxiety can distort my perception of things/catastrophize them - so i wanted some perspective on whether or not these are actual red flags - or normal kinks that come with maneuvering the non-profit sector. 

i'm a recent college graduate, and this is an entry level part time position. our team is comprised of a manager + director and i am the lowest-level employee. there seems to be a lot of disconnect between my manager/director - my director (who often gets final say on decisionmaking) is immensely scattered - will bail on meetings last minute (does this almost once a week, will often move a scheduled meeting 30 minutes late just because he's having a 'late lunch'), doesn't follow deadlines and ultimately my manager and i are left to figure things out on our own. the impression i'm getting is that he sort of does what ever he wants - and this impacts my manager - thus impacting me. 

when i started the job, they immediately threw me into a policy/stakeholder outreach project with no initial training - and even though i fared well and generally was able to learn as i go (thanks primarily to my manager - who i sense is also overworked) i felt off because my director said ""yeah i just put my name on the proposal so they know  that a director is there but you're going to be the lead on this"" two weeks in - i felt misled and irritated - i rationalized it as an opportunity for me to ""just do it"" and take initiative. among other things, i supposed to lead their 'engagement strategy' while also doubling up as their graphic designer (i volunteered this skill in the context of doing 'digital' engagement temporarily during the pandemic period) - even though they already have a marketing/communications manager. there is definitely the sense of 'many hats' being worn, as in i don't feel like my role is very well-defined and i'm doing very different things @ once

our meetings feel wasteful, and its often my director going on long arduous monologues about the minutiae of something irrelevant to the task at hand - rarely is my time respected (meetings will almost always go at least 30 minutes over, sometimes an entire hour). its hard to gauge because the nature of our work is *reactive* (in response to legislation/policy/events that happen at the city/county level) so there's always going to be a degree of needing to work on an ""as it comes"" basis, but a lot of times it really just feels like we are all compensating for where my director lacks in management &amp; organization. theres a lot of last-minute meetings - which frustrate me the most because it takes away from my ability to complete my work in a timely manner and maintain a work-life balance. 

i guess my question is - are these major red flags? are these things that can be remedied with more assertiveness and boundary-setting on my end (i am a people pleaser and sometimes undercut myself by staying silent). is this normal?",jobs,1.0

I got a job offer for a competitor company from my last company after getting let go.,"I was let go from my QA engineering position 3 weeks ago. I didn't expected to get let go but at the same time I wasn't shocked or cared. I really didn't like my job or the company, I dreaded going to work and was unhappy for months.  It was my first job out of college and I thought this is the best it could get and stayed with the company for almost two years.

After gettting let go I started to rediscovered myself and started enjoying things I struggled to do when I was working.  I  applied to my new company over a month ago and started the process of interviewing a week before I was terminated.

At what point should I expect bad news? (Waiting on app decision),"I have been interviewing for my dream job with a global company over the past six weeks. I “graduated” through interview rounds 1 to 3, and round 4 was a series of three final interviews. I felt super confident after four of the interviews, but iffy about the other two. I’ve received signals of positive affirmation like the recruiter stating “your interview went very well!”, responses to my post-interview thank you emails, and instant LinkedIn connections with my interviewers. I got the sense that they wanted to move urgently on filling the position. 

My final interview was this Monday, and the recruiter shared that the group was meeting for a final decision on Tuesday. Am I wrong to assume that I should have heard something by now if I was their first pic for the job?",jobs,1.0
Got fired 10-months into a job with no prior warning. I’m feeling sad/angry after I broke down crying. Was this my fault or something out of my control?," \*TL;DR at bottom 

Sorry, this is a long post, but I need to rant and get this out of my system. Please, excuse any typos or errors. 

Before joining this job, I had two years of experience in communications, marketing, and events -- working in different professional services companies.

I joined this job (an entry-level coordinator role) during the pandemic, so everything was remote, and I never met my colleagues in person. Every day I always logged in at 9:00 a.m., did every task and project on time, always lent a helping hand, enjoyed socializing with my colleagues, never complained whenever I had to work overtime and was keen on learning new things.

This morning, I had my bi-weekly 1:1 meeting with my manager. When I joined the Zoom call, my heart immediately sank when I saw my manager and the Head of HR. 

My manager says, “Sorry \_\_\_\_\_\_, you’re still new and growing in your career. We need someone with more experience, and we want to transition this role into a more senior position.” Then my manager dips out immediately, leaving only me and HR in the call. I broke down crying while HR explained the process and how my termination is effective immediately by 5:00 p.m. I asked if this was related to job performance because I never received any criticism or warning about my performance. She just said the same thing my manager said regarding experience. 

After the meeting, I signed the termination letter and called my friend about what the hell happened. I had until 5:00 p.m. before I’m locked out of the system. While feeling stressed and miserable -- I managed to transfer all my work to my cloud, called my three closest colleagues to bid them farewell, applied for government unemployment benefits, and called my student loans services to reduce my monthly payments. I also took the initiative to warn one of my colleagues that my work and responsibilities (which also included a bunch of admin tasks) might transfer to her, so I gave her access to my work, and I had to update external contacts that she’ll now be the main point of contact. I didn’t want to screw her over and make her contact IT if she couldn’t access my stuff.

I also asked my colleagues to give me truthful constructive criticism, and if I was shit at my job. They said I was competent and did everything on time. 

I feel angry and let down by my manager, who ghosted me for the rest of the day and carried on with their day as if nothing happened - didn’t send me a message or provide any kind words of encouragement, despite working with them for almost a year. I felt like I was beneath them and was nothing to my manager. It seems so cowardly for a manager to not be transparent with their direct report. 

If they wanted to make the position a more senior role, why can’t they train me? There were times when my manager cancelled our 1:1s and never helped me develop or grow in my position. They gave me less attention compared to my other coworkers. I was very vocal about expanding my horizon and taking on more responsibility. One time I asked if I could take over some of my other coworker’s tasks since she was transitioning from an internal to external communications role.

Was this all my fault, or was this out of my control? Was their reasoning bullshit? Do I have the right to feel angry?

Now I’m going to drink a lot of wine with a friend to deal with this shitty day. 

TL;DR: I got fired from my job with no warning after working 10 -months. My manager and HR provided a broad reason for my termination. They said they wanted someone with more experience and wanted to shift the role into a more senior position even though I had almost three years of work experience by then.",jobs,1.0

Open ended work hours - major red flag?,"I was interviewing for a salaried position at a large company, and for a substantial upgrade in pay compared to my current job. They told me pretty far into the process that the department's typical work day starts at about 6am and goes until ...? They basically said ""once your work for the day is done"". Sometimes they don't need to stay the whole time, and sometimes problems happen that require them to stay and help fix them. Someone else on the team told me they are typically there 6:30-4:30, but they are the only person I had a chance to talk to about it.

I could adjust to a 6am start time, but only if guaranteed an 8 hour workday max (plus 1 hour unpaid lunch, I assume). Occasional exceptions could be okay. But should I be seriously concerned about these open-ended hours if I value work/life balance? How would I go about requesting to maintain a 40 hour work week if they offer the job and this ends up being the deal breaker for me?",jobs,1.0
Why I took months off my resume and how I answer questions about 'gaps',"First, let me be clear. This probably isn't good advice, but I've had enough interviews where people are 'concerned' about the time I spent in between working, and less about my actual work experience and skills. Honestly, Is that really any of their business?

I try to be as nice as possible, This is my written response: 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;*I removed the months of employment from my resume for a reason. Most of my positions have been contract positions, the nature of which involve 'gaps' and what might be seen as 'job hopping' and therefore don't lend themselves to traditional analysis by HR professionals.*   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;( *If the HR system requires a month, one solution might be fill in the field with 01 for start date and 12 for end date. )*  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;*I want to promote conversation about how my experience and skillset are a good fit for the/their role. I find that if 'gaps' are present then the conversation becomes overly concerned with 'concerns' over my personal activities during time off.  In short, what I did during any 'gaps' in my resume was to 'enjoy life'*  

Yes I know this is going to be unpopular. Again, this is probably bad advice, but I think I've come to the conclusion that I'm just not interested in companies which are concerned about this.",jobs,1.0
Interviewing at the same company as my partner is interviewing at. Good idea / bad idea?,"A company in our area just opened up bunch of roles. My partner has been interviewing with them and is on the cusp of getting an offer.

need insight on my current work life,"I dont live In the US but I'll be using dollars(converted my local currency) as the money unit. This is my first job, I'm 18. It might sound weird but where I come from working before you turn 18 isn't common at all and my parents are middle class government employees so we have a lot of things subsidized.

I'm starting university in a new country in august meaning I'd only have to work for a month. I got a job as a cashier at a fast food place for the month. I'll start with the interview aspect. The employers weren't punctual at all. I had to wait a couple of hours before I had my interview and immediately I was interviewed I got the job.

I earn $97 a month and after taxes $90. This might be unusual but its just above minimum wage where im from. I dont have a car and id have to take the public transport daily and that would leave me with $76 at the end of the month. I work 8hours 30minutes a day, for 6 days a week so essentially im earning $2 an hour. The $76 varies because if we spill food or do any other dumb shit we get money deducted from us.

How to choose between two jobs,"Hi Reddit

I have been unemployed for 5 months - an experience I would not recommend to anyone.

Anyway, the sun decided to shine on me and I got two interviews. I am highly qualified for both of them.
But here's my dilemma. I only actually want one of the jobs.

The first job is nice, but it's not where I see myself in the future - even with advancement opportunities. But it's got a great salary, the hours aren't great but they're not awful, it's with a multinat, and it's a permanent post.

The second is the one I really want, but it's not even an open position. They're interviewing me with the potential of opening up a post for me because I connected with the Head of the Department on LI and he thinks I'm worth an interview. The salary isn't great (but not terrible), the position is far more junior and for a fixed term, and it's a further commute, but the hours are good and more importantly it's definitely a rung on a career ladder that I WANT to climb and my potential manager seems incredible and encouraging. The experience will be valuable.

So here's my dilemma.
The first interview is tomorrow.
The second interview is next Thursday.
That's quite a lot of space in between for a lot to happen.

I know it's presumptuous of me, but I have anxiety and I have to consider all possible outcomes.

1) I get offered post 1 and take it
2) I get offered post 2 and take it
3) I get offered post 1 but I decline and get offered post 2 and I take it.
4) I get offered post 1 but I decline and I don't get offered post 2 and I'm left unemployed.
5) I suck at both interviews and remain unemployed.

And I'm trying to sort through it to figure out what I'd do. Logically, I know that I want post 2. But I also know that I've been unemployed for 5 months and we're in the middle of a pandemic, and I need a job. So maybe I should take post 1 if it comes along first. But I also know for sure that I'd take post 2 if it came along - in a heartbeat.

I don't know.
How do I take this decision? How do you guys weigh this up?

"Honestly feeling completely defeated, even though I know I shouldn’t","I just graduated from college; and after only 2 months I’m already fucking over job searching. It feels like I’m on a hamster wheel; apply, rejected, apply, rejected, apply, ghosted, apply, rejected, apply, YAY I GOT AN INTERVIEW...don’t get past round 1, apply..........

I know the entry level market is completely fucked right now. I know that it usually takes several months to land a job out of college. I’ve even have a somewhat decent interview percentage (~11% based on my calculations). But it’s demoralizing. Especially seeing my peers come out of college with fantastic positions right out of the gate, while I can barely get companies to give me the time of day. 

The worst part is, I think I know why; I didn’t do a good job of networking in college. I’m on the autism spectrum and my ability to initiate social interaction is...not amazing My GPA is bad due to a semester where my mental health collapsed (but I made deans list twice after getting diagnosed and treated for ADHD) which resulted in me getting passed over for interviews. I have a good certification for my field but otherwise I’m a bottom of the barrel applicant. 

But I have no idea how to fix this. Graduate school is probably a no-go with my GPA (barely a 2.9). I need a job for experience but I can’t get a job for the experience. Internships, I can’t find any that are open to non-students in my field. I’m working on more certifications and independent projects, but this hasn’t led to anything at all yet.

I suspect that I might be in trouble when I get back, as my boss was audibly not thrilled by this interaction.

I’ve been working retail for the past 6 years, I worked my way quite a few times within the company and have been a store manager for the past 2 years. I loved the company I worked for. However, the corporate management is so out of touch (which I’m aware is pretty much the standard for retail companies) and I had a district realignment recently, so my store became under another district manager that was infamous for being a poor leader (the old district manager was respected highly). At this point I was pretty burnt out. I applied for an IT position at a government job, that is a pay cut short term, but long term the benefits would surpass the retail job. I took the job, have worked for a week, but have realized, while the job is pretty easy, I truly miss the fast paced environment of my old job, and I don’t see my IT company getting any faster of pace than it currently is.

Really worried about new job that I accepted and don't know what to do,"I recently accepted a job which I thought was a good opportunity, but is turning substantially less than what I had I mind. I wanted a job that could train significantly in soft skills. The job title (which has manager) and description made it seem like an exciting and interesting opportunity.

There is very little management involved. I accepted this role after receiving a head-nod at a potential promotion in my life role. The promotion also wasn't great but would've offered at least the sort of experience in soft skills I was looking for.

I'm left in this position of not knowing what to do. If my suspicions about my current role are true, there is no way I would spend more than 6 months doing it. This is causing me a lot of mental stress, and I'm doing the onboarding process, mentally absent and thinking how I regret making this move.

Any hacks for a job interview?,"I heard one recently that blew my mind.

If someone interviewing you asks what salary you want to make you should never tell them a number. You should give them a range like “I think $40,000 to $60,000 is a fair range for this role”. If you jump out and say you want to make $58,000 and the cap they have for the role is $52,000 they would automatically write you off and you won’t move forward.

I interviewed with a friends company recently and they asked a good friend in HR why I wasn’t giving an offer. I asked for $60,000 when they asked what the lowest amount I would expect for the role, when the cap was $55,000.

Have you ever done a “tryout” for a job? And were you paid for it?,"I applied for a job as a dishwasher. They told me to come in that Friday for a tryout. I figured it would just be an hour. It ended up being five.

During the time I was there was there I observed and worked beside the dishwasher on duty. I cleaned dishes and other duties.

I didn’t hear back from them, so I called Tuesday saying I wasn’t interested in the job but still wanted to be paid for the five hours I worked.

They told me to call another manager tomorrow morning. Then a few minutes later they called me back and told me they don’t have to pay me for that. I explained that the Employment Law Handbook covered training and my situation did not meet the criteria for unpaid training. They told me again to call the other manager tomorrow morning.

A few minutes after that they called me back and told me I could pick up my money tomorrow.

I came in the next day and the manager was pretty antagonistic, telling me he didn’t have to pay me legally, explaining the whole point of a tryout, asking me if I did take the job if I would quit after the first day.

I mentioned I was there for five hours. He said he didn’t know how that happened, despite the fact that he was there the whole time and saw me. 

This also seems off since another person was there for a tryout for a server position and was there for the whole shift.

He said a lot of other stuff and was really defensive about the whole thing. Told me he was just trying to help me. I mainly stood there silently waiting for my payment. He talked for about five minutes, constantly repeating himself.

I was offered a job from company ‘B’. They are a larger company but the position is data analysis. No travel required.  ~50k salaried

Quitting with little to no notice -- thoughts?,"Hi Y'all! I currently work for a small org with only 2 co-workers and a very hostile boss. I actually wrote my resignation two years ago when, in response to me needing to take some last minute time off around Thanksgiving because my sister was admitted to in-patient because her mental health took a dangerous turn, I was called into her office, berated, and told to ""not let it happen again."" My boss is a real piece of work it's amazing that I stuck it out for as long as I did. Having to deal with a hostile boss every day has just become too mentally exhausting especially when I want to be devoting my efforts to other things.     

I know I'm really supposed to give two weeks notice but I think I have enough mitigating factors that a two weeks notice is not strictly necessary:    
* I'm going to grad school in about two months    
* my 2 coworkers know that I'm starting grad school and are very supportive    
* my coworkers are actually the ones who suggested quitting with no notice because the last person who gave two weeks was harassed and belittled for the entire time    
* one of my coworkers outranks me and is functionally my supervisor, she is who I used for grad school apps and she has also offered to be my reference for this job

2 year gap in employment history - best way to explain?," 

Hi all,

I was hoping you could offer me advice.

I have a 2-year gap in my resume - I would like to have your advice on the best way for me to move forward and get back into entry-level employment.

The honest reason for the gap:

I graduated in mid 2018. I worked for 12 months. I then left my job in mid 2019 in order to pursue a business venture. I thought I am still young, it is now or never. I worked on my business from mid-2019 - mid-2020 - during this time I struggled to make any money. Then coronavirus happened which made it impossible and I closed the company.

Every day I was working on sales / marketing - but the business did not make any actual money. I was living of savings and eventually unemployment benefits.

In mid-2020, I ended up moving back with my parents, unemployed, and ended up spiraling into depression. I know it's not pretty, but it is the truth. Then with coronavirus happening, I began to take care of my grandmother. I'm now facing reality - which is - this 2-year gap in my resume. How can I best address this?

I do not think I can write self-employed, as the business made no money. I did no tax documents and dissolved the company. I have letters and documents that prove me setting up the company however no income from it. Thus, if I get asked for proof during a background check - I do not think this will be enough.

I do not want to put mental health as let's be honest, I know this will turn employers away.

I know it may be unethical, but I want to work as soon as possible and reduce my chances of NOT getting interviews. 

I have been advised to write: taking care of family member during the time of ill health (2019-2021)

I do take care of my grandmother daily and had to assist her during corona so it is not completely a lie. But, I've always done this - and of course, this is not the reason I had the gap in the first place. I just believe that this is the simplest way to explain the gap and increase my chances of actually getting interviews. Rather than saying I tried to start a business for a year, did not make any money, went onto unemployment benefits, coronavirus happened, I spiraled into depression.

What are your thoughts?

Can a background check ask for verification of this?

Do you think this is the best way to handle the gap in my resume? / What else would you all advise?

Thank you all so much in advance.",jobs,1.0

Leaving first professional job due to mental health?,"I would like some advice and/or support on a serious matter. I graduated college in December and was offered a job 1 week later. I started in January.

Background: I took a few years off between high school and college due to mental health and then to save up money for tuition. I worked at the same restaurant for almost 4 years. In that time, I completed my bachelors in 2 years, graduated with honors, and paid all of my tuition in cash (I’m debt free). While it was stressful, my mental health got a lot better. By the time I graduated, I was ecstatic to start a job and felt like my life was on the right track.

About 2 1/2 or 3 months in, something happened (I don’t know what) that made my anxiety go through the roof when it came to my job. All of a sudden, I was crying almost every moment of the day, having panic attacks during work, and a growing fear of being alone. Long story short, my mental health crashed and burned for some reason that I’m not sure of. And it continues to get worse every day. This is the worst my mental health has ever been.

I like this job. My boss is great, it’s in the field I want to be in, and I am learning so much. But for some reason, my job is attached to my mental health decline. The only way I see out of this is to quit and get help, but quitting terrifies me.

I’m afraid I won’t ever get hired again, I’m afraid what it’ll do to my career, etc. I’ve only been at my job 7 months, but I see no other way out.

I guess I’m just looking for advice on what I should do. How should I go about leaving? Will this ruin my career? Is this the right choice?

Thanks in advance. I feel very alone and scared of this decision and I am looking for advice wherever I can.",jobs,1.0

New job after psychosis (recovery) / 8 months,"Hi all,   
I had a weed induced psychosis last August 2020. I lost my job during recovery (contract was not extended, had 1 year contract). I started applying and searching for jobs around end of March 2021.   


I received 5 offers within 3 months after hunderds of interviews (The Netherlands btw). I did not feel a click/spark within the first 4 offers/company's and accepted the 5th one which was actually a promotion on paper (Warehouse Supervisor). I started 1st July 2021 and I got to say it's been very very dissapointing untill now. The avare age of the people in the warehouse is around 45+ (I am 31 years old), and I only have to manage a very small group of people, around 14. I managed 100+ people before this job. Also the responsibility's are extremely less then my previous position.  


My psychiatrist told me it's good that I accepted the job due i need to rebuild my social life and have a decent working schedule. So i kinda needed the job for recovery.   


My question is what to do in this position? Do I wait till i get use to the work/company? Or do I start applying again for another job, which I try to prevent due I switch jobs every 2 years and I want to stay stable at one company for atleast 5/7 years. Thanks all!",jobs,1.0
I didn't pass probationary period and they didn't give me any feedback...,"I worked at a non-profit organization for about 2 months.

How bad does it look to leave a position after a very short period?,"I've been at a new company for 3 months and I'm honestly just not very happy. The company seems like a bit of a mess, there's already been a lot of restructuring that didn't seem planned since I've joined and a lot of key figures leaving in just the three months. I do really like my boss, but he's clearly overstretched and currently over two teams when he should only be over one, so he doesn't have a lot of time for 1 on 1 work. The training program is basically non-existent and I've been thrown into it with little guidance. And I really don't like the software I'm working with (which is completely proprietary, and a huge part of my job)

I have some connections I can pull on as well as some pretty unique experience I could likely use to my advantage in a job search. But in my career, I've only had two jobs before this one (first was part time during high school and college, second was my first out of college) and I was at both for 5 years. Something I used in interviews is that I like to stay in one place. 

Would it forever be a blight on my resume to have such a short time at a company? Or would employers understand that maybe it just wasn't a good fit? 

I wouldn't leave until I had something new lined up, but I'm not sure if it's even worth attempting to interview elsewhere instead of just riding this out for longer",jobs,1.0
How's the job marker? My friend refuses to get a day job,"I have a friend who's an actor. She was doing ok before the pandemic, some plays and bits, paying her rent.

She was venting to me last night. Now that the world is opening, she says she can't take some acting jobs because she doesn't have a car. I ask her if she's trying to get a car. I asked her if she's been applying for other types of jobs. She says she's willing to do anything but nobody calls her back when she applies to Target or whatever. But also she doesn't want to do anything else besides act.... so I feel like she's not really trying to do anything.

I tell her she could always get a day job that's flexible and audition and save for a car. And she kinda just dismissed that.

for starters, she takes off every tuesday &amp; friday. she’s not very smart &amp; complains about every thing we do at the internship. i said i was going to take off a weekend because i had been working every weekend &amp; the day i was going to do it she did it right before me. then i felt like i couldn’t request off bc i would have more work for myself when i got back. &amp; the time off wouldn’t be worth it.

Am I crazy for quitting my for these reasons?,"I’ve been working at this immigration law firm since July 2020 as a case manager/paralegal. This happened a month after graduating. I was dumb to take the job because I was desperate to work and earn any income. Unfortunately this is a full time job that only pays $16 hour and that’s not enough to live in the city where I live.

I tried to think of this job different and embrace it as experience because I’ve been interested in law. But the way the office and employees are run is a nightmare. My mental health has been severely exhausted.

1. 3 people have quit in the past 9 months. The first person who quit, all her cases were transferred to me. Clients were severely upset. I was drowning because i went from handling 20 cases to almost 90 cases. Not only that, but the girl left a mess in the cases and clients were even more upset. I was struggling enough because I didn’t know the history of the case and what the girl did or didn’t do. Not even once was I was offered extra pay or anything for dealing with all the mess I dealt with. To this day, I’m still dealing with the mess. Especially because some clients aren’t getting approved for their Greencard and It is not my fault. 
2. Clients have consistently lied about me to the owner of the firm or others. For example, one person lied saying they’ve been calling the office asking for me for weeks but never got a call back. That was a complete lie. Then another person lied about giving me documents when it wasn’t true. And then I’m the one who suffers trying to defend myself from my employer when questioned.
3. Being told to do a job duty that belongs to someone else. Recently the admin people lost important paperwork and some passport photos. My supervisor instead of having them print a scanned copy and the photos on photo paper, had me do it instead. It wasn’t my fault these people lost the paperwork and they should’ve done the extra job. I spent hours trying to figure out how to print passport photos.
4. They recognize I’m a good employee but don’t bother giving me a raise unless I stay with them for years.

Im severely mentally exhausted. And I am trying hard to look at things differently but I cannot.

"CV/Cover Letter help for ""jack of all trades""??","I'm in the process of updating my resume/CV just to have on file. I feel like this is something that I should be doing at least every couple of years while my work experiences are fresh in my mind. My problem.. I have a vast array of jobs I have taken that don't particularly have any clear correlation between any of them. 

Here is my journey thus far: construction, handyman &gt; big box home improvement stores &gt; large equipment inventory, rental, dispatch &gt; autobody repair, painter &gt; freight cargo handler, logistics &gt; construction estimator, project manager'ish, accounts receivable/payable, online marketer (including videography/drone operator/editor), computer guru.

My concern is this.. I graduated from a state university almost 15 years ago and while I did well in school, when I graduated I came out with little direction and ""job hopped"", if you will, switching jobs after about 2 to 5 years max. I'm my own worst critic and have always told myself ""Who would want someone who seems so inconsistent with such little direction?"" I'm very prideful in my work, detail oriented, and consider myself an incredibly quick learner in any field. So... How can I tie these professions together or should I even focus on that? Should I only mention relative occupations to the job I plan to apply to? Should I make it a positive that I have a background in so many different fields? If so, how?

I don't have one particular position I plan to apply to at the moment. I'm just trying to get ahead of the game and while there are reports of a labor shortage, maybe use that as some bargaining leverage for higher pay. Additionally if anyone has any ideas as to what professions would be a good fit for me, I'm more than open to suggestions.

I got my first job by walking in the wrong entrance.,"I didn't know if this was the right place to post, I was gonna post it in r/tifu but it's not really a fuck up.

So I just turned 18 and moved to Colorado right after high school. I was living with my uncle and had interviews set up before I even got into the state. 

I had an interview with Chipotle and I was extremely nervous,  since it was my first job ever. So I call Chipotle trying to be professional and make sure they're still up for the interview, they tell me to come in between 12-1. 

So I finally go and walk in the store and I'm greeted by the manager at the register. I tell her I'm here for my interview and she looks a bit confused but tells me to sit and starts the interview. 

It goes amazing and I don't even feel nervous anymore, I end up talking and joking with her like I've known her for years. So she pretty much hired me on the spot and I'm extremely happy.

As she goes to get a packet for me to fill out, I start looking around and see that they are baking bread..I never been in a Chipotle so I just knew it was a burrito place, so maybe they baked bread as well? I didn't think too much about it because I just got my first job.

As I leave and meet up with my cousin who drove me, she ends up getting my work packet and says,
""This says Jimmy johns""

I never even heard of Jimmy John's since my hometown never had one. So I replied, 
""Maybe that's the name of the owner of this store""

""No, Jimmy John's is a sandwich shop...you walked in the wrong entrance"" she replies.


And that's when I realized Chipotle and Jimmy John's shared a building so I just saw the Chipotle sign. And assumed it was the whole building. And after working there for sometime, alot of customers walked in thinking it was Chipotle as well.

I wanna add at if I never walked in the wrong shop, then I never would have met a amazing coworker and I never would have had the opportunity to move to hawaii.

Jobs vs. entrepreneurship,"Hi guys

28M here and at a bit of a turning point in my career.

Currently deep into the teaching field and have gained experience managing schools (academic side). 

I will, for various reasons, be taking a 9 month career break in the next two years. I happen to work abroad from my home country.

Lately I've been looking to move jobs as there isn't really a step up for me going forward. I've dabbled in entrepreneurship and am fairly certain it will be my main focus post career break. Since I have two years to burn, I have decide to use those two years to work a job that is most efficient on time and salary as I see capital as the enabler for my business ventures and the key to most freedoms one can access in life.

My question is, do you think working a job vs entrepreneurship is comparable? In terms of long term fulfilment, potential wealth and autonomy?

For me, it's a no-brainer, but I wonder if there's anyone who can provide a solid argument for jobs above entrepreneurship.",jobs,1.0

CV/Resume Advice,"Hello,

I need advice on whether I can include this in my CV. I worked in a hotel for a year but prior to that I worked in a different hotel for four years.

During that time I helped train employees with set up, showing them how to do it but also showing them how to run the pass in the kitchen (bit where the food is prepped). I was never asked to do this by the employer and I wasn't assigned a specific person to train but I was wondering can I include this in my CV?

In the pass I just showed them how it operated, showed them how the floor worked, seat numbers etc. Would this count as training?

From Software Engineer to Blue Collar Trade,"Hey All, 

I'm a 35 year old software engineer at a mid-size company, making a good salary for my location. I've been a software engineer for just under 3 years now and while it can be rewarding and pays well I'm just not motivated by it like I was a few years ago.

All that said, I don't know if I like this type of work. I've been implementing or developing software for over 10 years now (before being a developer I was a software analyst) and while it paid the bills and I'm decent at it, I don't care about it. It gives me no joy or satisfaction at the end of the day.

With all that, I'm thinking about transitioning to a blue collar trade. I have a 5 month emergency fund plus enough savings to keep me alive for a few years if I was unemployed entirely. I'm debating between HVAC (my father has run and still does run a 2 man HVAC service and installation business) so I'd have an in there and the ability to apprentice. I'm also interested in carpentry but beyond internet searching, I don't know where to start.

I guess what I'm asking is: does anyone have experience moving from white collar software world to a blue collar career and is there any advice someone could offer? I also have the ability to scale my hours back at my current job and only work 3 or 4 days a week, leaving me with time to explore my next career move as well. Looking for any and all recs.",jobs,1.0
where do I go from here?,"hi so before I get into it here’s a little
background on me. 

i’m 22 and recently graduated from undergrad with my bachelors degrees in psychology. my original plan was to go to grad school and get a job in the psych field. however, when it came time to pick a specific master’s program there were none that stuck out to me. this coupled with my poor mental state/stress led to me deciding against grad school. I then tried to look for a job that only required a bachelors degree, but to no avail. so I reverted back to what I knew: nannying.

so here’s where my question comes in: what does the future hold for me? my options are as follows:

1. go to grad school and pick a masters program that i’m not too interested in, while putting myself in debt (I graduated from undergrad with no debt).

2. try to find a job using my bachelors degree, even tho that seemed impossible (recommendations helpful).

3. stay with nannying (forever?)

I do enjoy nannying and currently make good money doing so. my issue with it is that for the most part nannying is never a secure, long term position. with most other jobs, you know you will have a job until you quit or are fired. with nannying, the jobs are often temporary (kids get older, start school, etc). 

the lack of permanence and job security is something that is beginning to bother me as I get older and i’m not sure what to do from here. has anyone been in a similar situation? does anyone have advice? thanks.",jobs,1.0

Should I quit my summer job?,"This is my first time posting on reddit so I hope I havent made a mistake, but I need some advice! These past three days I started a job at some summer apartments. My job here is to make coffees, breakfasts, clean the pool and the bar area. My work hours arent very regular, but theyre generally from 8 30 to 14 00, and then from 17 00 to 20 00. My employers are really nice, and so are the people here, and its my first job so I'm glad I got it, but the problem is where Im staying. Basically, they provide me with breakfast (milk or bread or eggs and stuff from the breakfasts we might make and such) and lunch the lady responsible makes, but where I sleep is a ""general room"" of sorts, where my coworkers and employers can easily come and go, which is something im not very comfortable with. Also, I dont have a shower of my own, and I have to go to the room of another lady who works here to do so, which is something I quite dislike, both from an ""oh god this is awkward"" perspective, and a hygienic one. So Im really torn apart now, because I enjoy the job, and Id feel awful if I left, since the people are actually nice, and I dint think itd look good on my resume, but at the same time I cant stand the feeling of not having any personal space. I dont know, I feel like Im being ungrateful, especially since they provide me with so much, and they accepted me with no experience, so ive learned a lot already. What should I do?

Quitting a severely understaffed job,"I need some advice. I am 20f and working a casual job at a small business fast food place. This job had emotionally drained me to the max and I don't know how much longer I can stand it. 

I want to quit but we currently only have 3 senior staff that can run the store (including me) and 5 school aged juniors (that can only work past 5pm during the week). I work a big chunk of hours in the week (mainly working the closing shifts) but due to the understaffing I am so fucking stressed. I am also in my final semester of uni and I want to finish strong. I want to quit but I also don't want to leave the shop in disarray. We have been understaffed for 1.5 years now and I don't know if my managers are just lazy at hiring or if they can't find any more senior workers. 

Due to this I want to give a month notice but I'm nervous about handing in my resignation because my boss is so petty and I'm worried she'll either try to convince me to stay or make me feel horrible. It is good pay but I don't think its worth sacrificing my mental health and uni grades. I'm just not too sure how to go about leaving but not fucking them over and not making it incredibly awkward :/

Quitting a job after the first week,"So I got laid off by my company around January due to COVID related reasons and recently I found a job. 

They tried to lowball me hard on the offer but I asked for higher, around my old salary, which they accepted. 

At first they came off as cool and nice but then they started getting demanding. The boss texts me sporadically throughout days I’m not working sometimes and has no sense of personal and emotional energy.

He was even floating around the idea of me taking a 4:00 am shift, which is kind of odd and would include job functions that are different than what I signed up for. (Basically manning an office when they have an event despite me working in finance for that company).

The boss seems to imply that I’m not doing anything anyway and is eager to schedule me for anything. I had to tell him that I had another job just so he would leave me alone on odd hours.

I was initially excited but after all these red flags, I am bummed. It was advertised way differently in the interview.

It sucks because I’ve been out of work for 5 months and I just got a job. 

It really isn’t an environment or leadership style I like and it feels abusive. I would like to leave this arrangement. I have a few months funds saved up, but I’m worried being out of work any longer will effect my future prospects.

Should I quit my job?,"I’ve been in this field for ten years. How did I end up here? Let’s just say a company gave me an opportunity after college and over the years I just stayed in the field because I felt it’s the only experience I have. I’ve never enjoyed this profession, but the pay is good. I feel like I stay simply because of the pay. If I was making half of what I make I could easily say “I quit”. The job itself makes me have the worst anxiety/ stress. I know deep down inside I can’t live like this forever. It’s not good for my health. 

I recently changed jobs a few months ago (in the same field) to rule out if it was really just this field or if it’s me?

I'm Starting The Last Week of My Job. What Happens If I Work Past My Scheduled Hours? (Probably a Dumb Question),"(I don't know if this is the right subreddit, feel free to let me know if I should delete this and post else where)

For context, I work in a grocery store bakery. I usually have closing shifts and I'm usually the only one in the bakery scheduled from 1pm-10pm Thursdays-Sundays, the busiest days. Because I'm the only one there and I have to finish whatever the morning workers didn't do, keep the shelves full, do my closing duties, and help customers, I have never clocked out on time, and I usually clock out at around 11:30pm to 12am. Of course, I've had to sign papers to waive my second lunch break before since I hit my 5th hour a lot, and besides a few comments my managers never really are on me about clocking out on time. 

However, this is the final week of my job after resigning, and a coworker mentioned I need to work my scheduled hours exactly or else my paycheck gets delayed by like a week and I have to pick it up in person since the system doesn't recognize those extra hours or something. Does this mean I could get in trouble if I work late again? Do I have to let my managers know or sign any paperwork or anything like that, or just work how I usually do and go pick up my paycheck in person? 

Also, my very last shift is 1pm-10pm and I know for a fact I will not get out on time. I will try my hardest not to work until 12am again, but if I do does that technically mean since I worked until the ""next day"" after midnight, I would no longer be an employee and I could get in trouble? And how can I waive a lunch if I wouldn't technically won't an employee on that day? Or does it not even matter since it's technically the same shift?

Question about salary negotiations when you are moving from having a bonus plan to not.,"I currently make $x as my base salary with a 10% bonus plan, which pays out 20% at 70% of a goal, 100% at 100%, and 200% at 150%.

I am in the process of moving across teams to a team without a bonus plan. I am currently being offered almost exactly 1.1*x as a new base salary. This theoretically bakes in a year’s salary assuming we exactly nail the goal.

So if the team I’m leaving ever goes over 100% if the goal, I am basically taking a pay cut. But if they miss the goal, I am still paid as if we hit 100%. Companies obviously set the bar high so that 100% bonus payouts are not impossible but also not likely, so maybe a middle floor is better than a higher ceiling.

I also view this new role as a promotion, but this new salary doesn’t really feel like there is any raise involved. It seems like a direct translation from a salary+bonus role to a salary only role. Yes, the base salary rose, but only to make up for the bonus, nothing more.

What do you think? Is this a good deal? Should I ask for more? Should I only be happy with more? Should I be happy with this offer? Thanks for your input.",jobs,1.0

(Advice needed) Coworker told me my tone sounded too demanding,"Hi reddit! Sorry if there are any misspellings, english is not my main language. 
I work on retail and I really enjoy my job. The problem is certain coworkers. They usually do their job well until the manager leaves. Then they get on their phones and speak with their friends quite loudly. The store is small so customers can hear everything they are talking about and this makes some of them get upset and others even leave the store. I'm constantly having to do their work because they won't do anything unless they are supervised which makes things back up a lot. 
Today I gotta admit I was tired, I had been working for 10 hours the past 6 days so I felt exhausted. My manager gave a task to my coworker and then she left for the day. My coworker then proceeded to leave all the stock on the floor and call a friend. I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt but after seeing customers try to maneuver around the pile of stuff on the floor I had enough. Someone could had easily fall and get hurt. I went to him and told him if he could please finish his task. He said he was gonna wait for another coworker that was coming later on the day to do it. I asked him to at least move the things on the floor which he thankfully did do. Then I asked him to let me help him so we could finish it faster but he refused and told me he was gonna do it later. This happens a lot, they get assigned a task never finish it and then I have to do it for them. So I was frustrated but I left it at that and went on with my day. When I was about to head home he came to me and told me he didn't like that my tone sounded too demanding and that he knows how to do his job. It made me feel a little uncomfortable but I apologized and told him that I was sorry if I sounded like that and that I didn't meant it. I don't do well in confrontations, and I'm just a retail associate like him not his boss so I felt like I shouldn't had said anything.
 I feel bad cuss I want to get along with everyone but I do care about customers and giving a good service. It makes me feel uncomfortable when they say things like ""I hate all our customers"" and trash talk the manager that is the nicest manager I have ever had.

"How do you internalize a salary downgrade, by breaking into a new field?","Unsure if this is relevant to this subreddit, but it's a concern iv'e had lately. I'm in Toronto. I make 50K. It's a solid salary. Sadly, the field i'm in is very restirctive. I'm looking to make the jump to IT, but everything iv'e read says i'll be making substantially under my 50K. Which is fine, i'll eventually make more, but i'm concerned with basically my salary going from over 20 ish an hour, (im guesstimating 25, im unsure on how you factor it in tbh) to 20 if i'm LUCKY, probably less, for at least a year.

Left my shifts early 3 times within a week due to physical health issues... Will I be terminated?,"I work at a very fast paced restaurant that I love.

I left all of my 8/8.5 hour shifts around 3 or 4 hours early—3 times within the past week. Twice due to my carpal tunnel and cubital tunnel syndrome, and once, today, due to the heat wave. Not only that, I also called out last minute to go to the emergency room for my arm/wrist issues.

My boss knows my appointment with an orthopedic surgeon is coming up on Wednesday. Though, I fear me leaving early so frequently, even with my health issues, will cause a problem where I’d be terminated.

What steps should I possibly take to get on my boss’ good side? Or is it likely I’d be terminated?

The endless despair of making the wrong choice,"A while back, I quit my job working in finance (I'm a CPA) at a toxic hell of a workplace. Luckily, I found myself with multiple offers to choose from. I was so careful in making my choice.. Consulted multiple people, and spent many hours researching, pondering, and comparing. I ended up taking the job that I felt would be the best fit. It didn't pay as much as my other options, but I felt like it would be the best for career growth and advancement. 

As you can probably guess, it didn't work out. I left after just under 1.5 months. They hid the high turnover and poor team morale from me during the interviewing period. It wasn't until I was actually working there that I realized this job was not what I had expected. I couldn't make it work despite doing everything I could to manage the poor communication/crazy expectations, and god knows I tried my very best to stay. 

I've been actively applying to jobs for the past few weeks and things have been incredibly slow.. I feel completely broken. I'll have a several month gap in my resume and feel crappy about needing to explain it someday. I felt good about feeling like I was in demand. Not anymore. I feel like I failed myself even though I made the best choice based on what I knew at the time. It really sucks because I might not be sitting here today writing this crappy post if I had chosen one of the better-paying options. Maybe I'd still have a job. Summer hiring is slower than I had expected. Who knows how long it'll be until I get another offer. 

I question my ability to get through this. Financially, I will be okay for a while. But in all other aspects, not so much.

"Work announced mass return to office, discussing internal jobs with supervisor","I'm in a very in demand field, software development. Recently our company (massive corp) announced a return without employee input. 

Despite requesting a permanent home arrangement a few months ago (and following up several times), I was told to wait for a response from the senior management team. Now, with the announcement and several town hall style sessions, it seems there will be no new arrangements for staff. 

Here's the thing, I actually like my job and company a lot, but a like my family time a hell of a lot more!

Internally there are a few jobs aligning nicely with my skill-set that may be remote. Before I send out questions to the hiring managers, I'd definitely need to let my boss know.

Are my parents right that it'll significantly hurt my employability? All of the jobs I'm going to be applying for will be WFH and no one will be seeing me once I'm working.

"I fell into a full time temporary teacher role at 23, and I’m petrified to be honest, I didn't think I would be the actual teacher","Hey everyone, I graduated with a Sociology degree in the heat of the pandemic last summer, couldn’t find substantial work, outside of a few temporary jobs. I had a bit of volunteering experience working with youth at community centers and doing service trips etc. I worked with kids at these centers, but often times was just a helper to the teacher, or was apart of a big group of workers working with a bunch of children.

Recently I was hired at a community center to be a Youth Specialist, and didn’t think much of it, I read the job description and from what I could tell it’s the same old with a bit more responsibility, but my impression was I’d be working with someone. It was never my plan to work with kids or be a teacher, in a perfect world I'd be doing research on urban poverty, or helping adults find affordable housing, or something along lines of social work. I took this job because I like kids enough that I thought it would be fun, and it lends itself to those other careers possibly down the line for something more permanent.

I showed up for my first day today and learned that tomorrow I would be with a group of kids tomorrow of about 12, from 9 to 5, and have to come up with activities until end of July, to keep them occupied and instill positive habits.

I know it doesn’t seem like much to you guys as educators, but as someone who didn’t go to school for teaching, I am a bit terrified by this prospect, prior to this the kids I worked with are usually older, 14-17, and I prefer that age group just because it’s more relatable. But I’ve never been with a group of children alone like this and feel like I’m way over my head. (The kids are 7-9)

Part of me feels like It might be better for me to do this and see this through, it’s a month and I can learn a lot, but the reality is, I don’t think I want to be a teacher, this wasn’t really my desired path at all, and I didn’t think I was going to be given the keys to the entire classroom for 40 hours a week, I have no idea what to do with these kids and the thought of them looking at me for the next thing to do is terrifying.

I feel like I might be better off going to the supervisor and telling them, this wasn’t what I thought it was going to be, and I can’t handle being the main person for an entire class of kids, but same time I’m not sure their gonna have a teacher after me outside an administrator and the kids seemed pretty juiced at idea of me teaching them.

I didn’t think it was going to be this, partially that might be my mistake, and I feel bad but it was just a misunderstanding, they never explicitly said I would be running a class, I like the people, kids seem okay given their circumstances. I just don’t know if I have it in me to be the main person for this group, but thought of ditching them after one day feels shitty and I don't know if I have it in me, but I have no idea what I'm doing I feel like.

We discussed notice periods (for me, it is one month) and I haven't mentioned anything to my current workplace and don't plan to until I review and sign a contract. 

I believe there may also be salary negotiation. Considering this role is new to me but I have enough years experience within customer facing roles and related roles to the job, should I negotiate for the higher end of the salary? So (example) they offer between 40k - 45k, should I ask for something in the 43 - 44k range or ask them what they plan to offer first and negotiate from there?

They have also asked for two references, one of which will be my current manager and we have a good relationship but I took a few weeks off very recently due to work stress, would that be included in the reference?

I wish they didn’t tell me their plans. I can’t tell him, obviously. But, he’ll ask how the interview went and I don’t know what to say.",jobs,1.0
Got a write up today,"I’ve been at this job two months. I haven’t been late or called out. Today, I ate breakfast like usual, and got sick. I don’t know if it was the eggs or bread. Maybe the milk? But either way, I got really sick. Dizzy and nauseous. I’ve gotten food poisoning now, THREE times. So I know the symptoms and know I couldn’t work.

It was about 15 minutes before my shift (I know, bad timing) but I literally could not have had worse timing. I get up at 8 and make food. Then I shower. So it just hit me around 9:20ish. I leave for work at 9:30. 

When I told my manager, I told them the situation and said I knew it wasn’t ideal and apologized. They said if I can’t make it then I can’t but they will write me up for calling out 15 minutes before. I told them I could get a doctors note but still said “either way I’m sorry for the inconvenience” 

No response. 

I feel like crap. Physically and mentally. I just woke up from a long sleep and my nausea hasn’t gone away. It’s late so I don’t know if I can’t go to the doctors since they closed. How can I get proof? I can’t look for a new job right now as I have a good schedule.",jobs,1.0

Can anyone give this rusty hound some interviewing tips?,"Okay, I'm not that much of a rusty hound but I've been in union construction for 5 years, basically my whole working life after college and I don't got much interviewing experience besides all I know is to smell good, look good, sit up straight, have a positive attitude and try to crack a few smiles. I think this is a group interview which makes me nervous, I'm very outgoing when knowing people and or being in a very small group, not big groups.

I just hope I don't bomb this interview because this is one of the best paying jobs in the area and easiest type of work. I hope my construction background wows them.",jobs,1.0

How to write/give resignation?,"I finally got a job I am super excited about and can leave my toxic workplace! This is my first time resigning. Do I need to print, sign, and scan to my boss? Can I just send an email? I start my new gig August 2 and want to work until the end of July. I am completely changing careers and moving to a new city. I don’t want to be nasty but at the same time I am never going to use anyone here as a reference. I say this bc I would assume normally you have a meeting or phone call about the situation, but I don’t think I owe my boss that lol.

Context: I think this is going to blindside everyone as I keep my thoughts to myself. It’s a long story, but basically I work a job that can be done remotely. In may of 2020 I was told to go back in the office. I’m in a 2 person department end the other person (my boss) got to continue working from home and still is. We will go days without talking and she will just randomly call me. I try to avoid communicating with her since there is no use trying to fix things (I decided a few months into the job I would be leaving because she spent an entire day bullying me, but then the pandemic and hiring freezes hit). She constantly demeans me by speaking to me like a child and gaslights me until I don’t believe my own thoughts sooooo yeah",jobs,1.0

Has anyone gone back to school? / Has anyone turned their life around?,"I just graduated 3 weeks ago from UC Davis with a degree in ""Cinema and Digital Media"". It was really just film analysis, film history, and social studies with a couple of production courses here and there. Pretty broad and useless imo. 

I used to want to work in film to eventually become a director, but after reading and learning about what life in the industry is like (long hours, little pay, horrible work-life balance) it just seems...not worth it. 

I only have 14k in debt and my mom even said ""if you want to go back to school I'll help you out""

I'd like to have a career with good earnings. Something with regularity. Going into an office sounds nice. 

 I'm pretty social-anxiety ridden. Got basically zero friends. Also observed that I'm kind of lazy. I don't want to be this way but it's been very hard for me to find the energy to change. 

I don't know. Is there anyone in this sub reddit who was a wreck and turned themselves around? If so, how did you do it?

When to expect virtual interview link?,"Hi everyone, I recently applied to a job and was invited for a virtual interview next week!

"Been working a job for 3.5 months, pretty sure I’m being pushed out. What should I do?","Hi all, I accepted a job offer in March that was first remote, then I have been in office when I relocated for the job last month. I had thought that everything in my job was going well, since I never received any negative feedback and seemed to be progressing along nicely. 

Unfortunately, I was wrong. I have weekly meetings with my direct manager, and suddenly he brought up last week that he’s “seriously concerned” about my progress at work and afraid that I won’t be able to live up to my coworker’s levels of work. I’m supposed to be taking over the accounts of a coworker who is moving for another job. What bothers me is that he was like “why didn’t you say anything about needing help?” UH… because I thought I was doing well? It was news to me that I wasn’t performing well enough. 

The thing is… I’m trying my hardest. I’m giving 150%. I was already on edge about this job because of the culture being incredibly dated and not fitting of my personality, and how my department was promised a pay raise that was swiftly cut, and our department’s VP was fired after a month of being hired. The company has an incredibly high turnover rate already, so this is deeply concerning. 

The reason I think I’m being pushed out is that I have NEVER gotten feedback from my boss until last week. He tells me things I need to fix, and I’m already doing them. My coworkers are very cold and snippy with me, but chummy and friendly with each other, eve when I try to socialize. I tell my boss what could help me work better, and nothing has changed. 

This is my first job out of college, and I  already feel isolated. It’s not even my desired field- I took this job to escape my abusive family and get health insurance. If I don’t get fired from this job, what should I do in the meantime? Thanks :)",jobs,1.0
Employment Background Check,"I have an accepted offer for a new job, but they are only now (after I accepted) doing any sort of employment background/verification check. While there isn't anything that concerns me within that background, it's a 3rd party HR platform that is doing the check, and I just feel a bit weird having them call around, especially to my current employer. 

They do offer the option to decline to provide permission to contact said employers, and to provide either a W2 or paystub to prove employment during the referenced period. I have those, so no problem there. I was just curious, is there any reason that providing verification that way would be problematic? They allow for the option, so I wouldn't think so but I was curious if there's anything that I should be aware of before finalizing sending that information.",jobs,1.0
"Is this understandable, or should I run away?","I'm currently employed making good money at a big corporate job that is pleasant enough. My coworkers are great, but I'm kind of unhappy that now we're likely to be remote always. Further, it's the typical corporate job: you come in, do your  job, and only care about getting your work done because you want to do a good job at whatever you do. I'm not complaining; it's a good job.

Despite the above, I saw an opening for a position that I'm extremely qualified for at an organization whose work I support immensely, and which I respect (or had respected) a great deal. I applied for the job, and they they set up a phone interview with me, and then, another...and so on. It was basically:

* First week of May: send application
* Second week of May: first interview with a person who was very enthusiastic
* Second to third week of May: called my references, all of whom gave glowing comments
* Third week of May: Interview with a second person who said she was traveling, but wanted to talk to me since it was a priority; said she thought I was great from my cover letter and just wanted to confirm; very enthusiastic
* Fourth week of May: Interview with two more people; they were friendly
* Second week of June: Interview with two more people, both of whom were friendly
* Second week of June: Silence. I followed up with an email; they said they were very busy with planning an event; I sent emails wishing success in the event
* Third week of June, event they were organizing happens; I get an email saying I should hear by the fourth week in June
* Now: I've followed up, nothing.

I've worked to hire people before, and this is quite obviously insane: two months of interviews with six people, after they say filling the job is a priority and they know I'm right for it, and after contacting all my references. If I was part of that process, I'd be embarrassed. But should I just chalk this up to over caution for a small organization? Or should I cut bait and run, sending them a polite email that I'm removing my candidacy from the job pool (potentially freeing them up to hire whoever else, and maybe actually  fill the role that they desperately need filled)?

I really would like to work on the mission of the organization, and I'm 99 percent certain there is no one who's a better fit than I am (this is not bragging; I have done this exact job before, have all the skills, and am willing to take a big pay cut to do it, and it's a mission that's not particularly popular at the moment).  But at the same time, maybe it's a bad idea to leave my current, high-paying and stable job to work at an organization that, at least in terms of hiring practices, seems not to know what it's doing, and is spending months filling an important role.

Should I keep considering this job, or should I just send a message in the morning saying that I've decided to stay at my current job? That might be helpful to them, if they are trying to decide between two candidates.",jobs,1.0

Where to find a job for 1 month?,"Hey ya'll,   
I'm having the biggest issue finding a job/moral dilemma. I've been a full time student for the past year and my husband has supported us. Which is great and all.   


But, I have 6 years of customer service experience(serving, hosting, sales), Microsoft certified, Healthcare experience, 4 weeks from my AS in Science, BLS certified, and all that hoorah  


However, we are almost 1 month out from moving out of state and we need more money! So I need a job but I don't really know where to start and apply to get a decent pay over $10/hr. I also have the moral dilemma of letting a company train me but not telling them I'll only be here a month or if I shouldn't say anything and get hired and then have to put in my 2 weeks in 2 weeks.   


And before anyone says anything, we're military. We knew we were separating but we had no idea when we were leaving until 2 weeks ago. Then last week we had to take a trip there for jobs and housing, and just got back in town. With a month and a half heads up of our actual separation date.

My employer offered my wife a job and then ghosted her,"Recently the company I work for recruited my wife for a new position they were creating. I am a senior manager for this medium sized company and my direct report is the COO. This COO knew what my wife does for a career and told me she might be a good fit. I spoke with the department manager making the hire and he said my wife should contact him. A few days later they met for a Zoom interview and he offered her the job on the spot. They agreed on salary, start date and roles and responsibilities. However, this manager told my wife it would be a few days to a week before he would get her a written offer- FYI this is extremely unusual for how my company works.

&amp;#x200B;

A week passed with no word from the manager. My wife reached out to him for an update. He said he's ""waiting for feedback"" and will contact her soon. Waiting for feedback? He had hired her that day and then came to my office to tell me how he looks forward to working with her. This wasn't something that my wife and I imagined.

&amp;#x200B;

The agreed upon start date has now passed, and this manager has not replied to any other updates. My wife is absolutely devastated, and she feels duped. After being unemployed for so long, she told our friends and family she got a job. Her mom even sent her a bottle of champagne. They didn't hire anyone else by the way.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure what I can do to help her. However I know I can't in good faith keep working for a company that did this to my wife and made her question her own self-worth. Should I go to HR? Thing is I worry about retaliation. I should probably also begin looking for work elsewhere, but I have only been in this job for 5 months and I am not sure how to explain to another employer why I am suddenly on the market.",jobs,1.0
I got laid off and offered severance.. meanwhile discussing other internal roles,"I got laid off and my last day is this Friday. They gave severance letter and said they'll pay bi-weekly like how I was originally paid so far as an employee. 

Question is that I am discussing other internal roles with another department currently. There is a high chance that I will get this job. It looks like it'll take at least another 1-2 weeks that I will get the offer and finalize it. The severance letter stated that if I get employed by this company again during the severance pay period, severance will stop. 

In this case, should I just sign the document ASAP so I get the severance for the days in between my termination date and when I am hired by them again? Or should I wait few more days to see what my other internal role's process is?",jobs,1.0

Did I get the job after 3 interviews for the position ?,"So on June 18th I get an email from a recruiter from a company that says she thinks I would be a great fit for a position. I researched the company and position and thought It was a great fit for me. I called the recruiter and we had a great interview and they told me they would send my resume over to the person I’d work for to see if they’d like to interview me.

Following Monday, I get a call from the recruiter and they told me that that the person loved my résumé and if I’d like to do an interview via zoom the next day. I did the interview with the employer as well as another person who previously was in the position I was applying for. The interview went amazing after 45 min very casual answered every question perfectly, I asked them questions ended amazing. Called the recruiter told them how it went, they were happy.

Next day, I get a call from recruiter to set up a face to face interview with the president of the company... came in and felt like I already worked there... everyone was amazing I had an hour interview with the president and majority questions were personal like tell me about your life, your dogs, what makes you tick to the point I was learning about their family and stuff. The president said I was very different than others in a good way, also said I’m very focused on what I want but I’m moldable and flexible in my goals which was great. 

The next day the recruiter emails me saying I got positive feedback from the president and this week i would be hearing back because there’s still some interviews being done by the person I’d work for...
